This place is one of my favorite comic shops. I actually live closer to a different one, but I drive to chandler just to go to this one. I like their selection and when they have the dollar sale you can get some ridiculous deals. The staff is ridiculously friendly and I usually always walk out with whatever I wanted. They also have some cool events from time to time and i've found their prices to be reasonable and comparable to other comic shops.	positive
The wait time for an appointment is ridiculous. Been waiting over an hour and a half for my scheduled appointment time. These people do not value patients time	negative
I did not like this hotel at all. It's very old and not comforts in it. \nThe good thing is that it was cheap but at the time was like a room just to sleep! \nThere is no view at all and while you are in the Vegas it should not be those kind of rooms. \nWhen we came in to the room we just sow a trash cans and an a conditioner staff...!!!\nBut the Casino and staff were good and cute  ...it's was almost like we were in the animation movies...but inside the casino...	negative
Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and simply needed to get my food quickly and go.\n\nThe restaurant itself is just fine. There was good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The line was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.	positive
Favorite sushi place in NV!  Price is reasonable and food is incredible!  I will eat there every time I go to Las Vegas.	positive
Absolutely A-1 coffee shop! Very comfortable, inviting place with a very homey feel to it; to the right of the counter there's some pretty cool art displayed on the wall, as well as bookshelves packed with many books to choose from if you want some good reading to go along with your coffee. The staff is fast, attentive, & as friendly as can be, & as far as the coffee? Not too sweet, not too rich, but a perfect balance of the two! Great selection, great prices, great staff, & just an overall awesome coffee shop! The flavor of the coffee alone is enough to keep you coming back for more, & the welcoming feel of the shop overall is just an added bonus! The only regret I have is that there isn't one a little closer to where we live, but it's honestly worth the minimal travel time. If you haven't tried Grouchy John's it's definitely worth your while to check it out & pay this coffee shop a visit!	positive

"OUR ROOM WAS LEAKING WATER! We woke up @ 3am to the sound of water dripping on the floor. We called the front desk (took 5 minutes for someone to pick up) and the lady told us she will move us to another room. So we have to pack up all our stuff to move to another room. So where do we move at 3am in the morning, all the way to the end of the Tower.\n\nIt took us 5-6 minutes of walking just to reach it! And apparently the pyramid leaks water according to the bell boy that helped us move. They put us in a nice room (mold was on the ceiling, we were too tired to care), better then the one before but it was already 4 in the morning by the time we reached it and unpacked, and we were going to check out at 10 am.\n\nSo during check out, we ask the front desk if there is anything they can do for us, and this rude manager comes over who seems already mad at us for even asking such a thing. She yells \""""we put you in a better room then the one you had before so in our view you have already been comp\"""". But we were only in there for 4 hours and that was to sleep, we would have been fine with the same room we had before. We didn't ask for a better room, just one that wasn't leaking water! She didn't want to hear it and said she can't do anything for us except comp us a free buffet, ROFL wow thats it?\n\nWe sold out and took it, we were hungry and tired. So we get to the register of the buffet and they couldn't find our comp! I was like WTF, COME ON! The lady behind the register took our names and room number down and we finally got in for free (or so I thought). So a half  week later, back at my house I noticed on my back account a $40 change from Luxor, I WAS LIKE WTF!?!? I called and they charged me for my buffet! \n\nI WILL NEVER STAY IN THE LUXOR AGAIN! DO NOT BOOK A ROOM WITH THE LUXOR YOU WILL REGRET IT!"	negative
Very expensive!!!\nSound and environment was OK.\n$22 for two tickets is just not worth it, I would rather watch a movie at home where it is also more comfortable.\nWe went on a Saturday night and most of the theater was empty, only 2 other people were in the theater/movie we watched, the parking lot was also less than half full while in the past it used to be full and hard to find a parking spot let alone by the door.\nThey need to drop the price by at least 50% before I would go back...	negative

"If only you could give out 10 starts, i think i would still have to give this place 11!! :)\n\nI never knew shshi could be this good!!!! Located on Eastern and Coranado, next to Trader Joe's, this is the place to go for sushi and also a good time! The owner Eddie pratically lives there... I think he has a matterss in the back somewhere. He is ALWAYS there which is awesome cause that means you can go anyday you want at any time and you will have the best sushi chef there to create the most amazing fish you have ever had.\n\nThe rolls are inventive and delicious. Eddie needs to sign up for a \""""how fast can you make sushi contest\"""" cause im telling you he would totally WIN!! Almost before you can tell him what it is you want he is handing it to you! \n\nI feel that part of the sushi experience is sitting at the bar and talking with the sushi chef. I have to believe that Eddie agrees with that cause he is very charming and engaging... he makes you laugh and smile, and well... just feel welcomed!!!\n\nThis place is fairly new but has a major following already. Once you go there you are hooked! The 1st time we went there it was so delicious that i wanted to go back the next day! (That never happens) Im telling you i dreamed about this place (the Danny handroll & Princess Deana roll to be exact) and when i called my brother to tell him how much i loved it (he told me about it) and that i wanted to go back the next day he said \""""yeah, i understand, we went 3 days in a row when we found it\"""" which then kinda gave me the ok to go again the next day and not feel bad!! :) thanks bro! \n\nIf you dont want to go to the strip and you want some AMAZING susi-this is the place to go! Just make sure you dont already have dinner plans for the night after, cause i guarentee you that you will want to go back again!! \n\nThank you Eddie, for bring to Henderson the best sushi EVER!!

"Craving a good burger and based on a co-workers advise decided to try out Blue 32 Sports Grill.\nWaitress was friendly and attentive.

I would suggest using the cayenne pepper as an add-in for those who like spicy foods. \n\nI also ordered the Blue 32 Steak Sandwich.

It would have been nice to have the mushrooms and onions sliced up and caramelized together on the grill then tossed in with grilled STEAK and cheese mixed in (instead the cheese was \""""blobbed\"""" on\""""\n\nI am a mom that loves to cook and has a family that loves to eat my cooking.

I love all my carbs toasted. I would rather be late for work and take the time to toast my bagel than eat it untoasted. This place drew me in because all their subs are TOASTED. Toasted to perfection, served warm, with just a little bit of golden brown starting to appear on the bread. Mmmm....heaven. \n\nThis place has a fun vibe. Reggae music playing, really chill workers, plenty of seating inside. Their sandwiches come in 3 sizes 4 inches up to 12 inches. Nicely priced and a pretty extensive menu. \n\nI got the Kali Mist which was delicious. Had a bit of kick to it, nicely sauced. I hate dry sandwiches. Can't wait to come back and try all their subs. They have a fun selection of desserts  rice krispies but also captain crunch krispy bars, cinnamon toast crunch bars, and fruity pebble bars. \n\nSorry Jimmy John's, Which Wich, Firehouse Subs, Quizno's... every other sub place on state street I'm starting a love affair with Cheeba Hut.	positive

"I dig the melting pot, i mean, its fun. Fondue=fun. This was another  \""""Yay my birthday is during restaurant week!\"""" dinner for me. The cheeses, meat course and salad are good but lets be honest that dessert is where its at. Id get all 3 courses as dessert if i could.   A big pot of chocolate and then cheesecake, rise crispies, bananas, strawberries, red velvet cake and marshmallows all to dip into it. Heavenly is an understatement. \nI also dig that your in control of your own cooking times. So what if i cook my steak for 10 seconds...rare is good yo...\nGoing with a large group is smart. Then you can really sample a lot of the stuff on the menu. Our party had 8 peeps in it so we got 3 different cheeses, cooking styles and  chocolates. Service was aiiiiiight considering it was a large party, but it coulda been better. I normally wouldn't be able to afford more than one course here but at $30 for everything during restaurant week it's a hella great deal."	positive

"So this weekend my 2 cousins and I decided we wanted to get our hair and makeup done at Platinum Entourage. We made reservations for 6pm for three people, assuming that we were going to get our hair done @ 6pm and then proceed to makeup done. Well we come to find that there is only one makeup artist and we all get our hair and makeup done at different times.  Most companies I have gone to in Hollywood they normally will have enough staff members to fulfill the clients' need, and not try to \""""flip-flop\"""" (that's what prick called it) everyone around because they only have one makeup artist. According to the prick, they just \""""flip-flop\"""" everyone around regardless of the time you made your appointment, so if you made it at 6pm chances are you won't be seen till 6:45pm.  So not only was that the stupidest business model for a company to have if they specialize in doing hair and makeup but the customer service was garbage. They were sooooooo rude about the entire situation. The receptionist didn't want to take any responsibility for the mix up, and the other guy was a complete prick in the manner that he spoke to us. To make matters worse they screwed up on the type of appointments, and then accused us of calling and canceling one of the makeup appointments!!!! I agree mistakes happen ALL the time, at first I wasn't upset until the prick came over to speak to us.  The manner that they dealt with the entire situation was disgusting, unprofessional and ignorant. NOW I can't say anything about the makeup artist because well we didn't get anything done due to all the screw ups, however, my cousin got her hair done and well it was nothing impressive."	negative
I went here alone when I first moved to Pittsburgh. Maybe it would've been a better experience had I not been alone, but I go out alone a lot, and I've never felt as awkward as I did when I walked into Gooski's. Everyone turned to look at me as I came in the door, and their eyes followed me until I took a seat in a booth by myself (do I have something on my face?). I grabbed a beer, sat and drank it and decided to leave rather than stay. It didn't feel very friendly to me.. but maybe I'll give it a second chance, based on some of these other reviews.	negative
After a bad experience at our Favorite Restaurant Roca Akor in Scottsdale, we turned to Yelp and Roka's very capable manager Charles responded within an hour, invited us back and more than made it right.  We knew they had great food and now, thanks to Charles, we know they have great management.  We highly recommend it.	positive
I came here on a Saturday night in the summer around 930. They quoted us a wait time of 70 minutes. We had our hearts set on this place, so we said we'd wait. But the best part was that they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. This was awesome! We got to hang out in the casino and get drinks until our table was ready. Once we were seated we were shown the drink menu. The drinks all looked amazing. Unfortunately, I was the DD for the night. We ordered parmesan (sp?) truffle fries and they were AMAZING! No joke, the best fries I've ever had in my life. The burgers were absolutely delicious. They were cooked to perfection. I hardly ever order a burger medium, and get a burger medium. It's always too well done. But this was perfect. Two friends I was there with ordered their's medium rare and you could see that theirs were absolutely medium rare and noticeably different from my medium. My husband and I keep a list of our top 5 burger places (similar to 'the list' from Friends), and this place shot to the top. We also ordered the Oreo shake and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Sticky toffee pudding is one of my all time favorites, but it was not at all good here. The shake was good, but I wish they had a malt option. Still, the sub-par desserts weren't enough to detract from the 5 star rating. Also, the servers' outfits are absolutely hideous, truly the most unflattering ensemble I could imagine for a server, but that's my only real criticism, which is hardly relevant at all.	positive
I have to say that this all-you-can-eat sushi buffet wasn't too bad. The service and ambiance was definitely better than Sushimon, but when it comes down to quality, taste, and presentation....Sushimon wins the competition!\n\nIf you don't mind driving a bit off the strip, then come to this sushi place. It was only $22 for lunch when my friends and I went here on a Saturday.\n\nSorry, peeps...Sushimon is still better for me...	positive
Had breakfast here today and it was excellent! The server was fast,  & friendly. Food was hot, fresh and tasty. Will come back again and try the other menu items.	positive
Football is king at Towne Tavern, and the brother princes of hockey, basketball and baseball vie for the crown throughout the year. Their court is comprised of raucous crews of kids eating for free on Tuesday nights and rogue interlopers consuming regular drink specials. Their lovely pedestal-seated princess is the most glorious ranch dressing in all of the land, who is often attacked by guerilla French fries who want her all to themselves.\n\nDecorated in traditional sports bar regalia, but focusing on the far away upstate New York and neighboring New England teams, Towne Tavern has a visible love for the refugees of cruelly cold winters. They come to Towne Tavern to eat, drink and reminisce about their homeland, and cheer for the Carolina teams on the side.\n\nTowne Tavern's menu is highlighted by their burgers and sandwiches, and their surprising level of quality salads, which are high in dark green lettuce content rather than iceberg, as many restaurants of that plane push.\n\nService is inconsistent at TT at times; however, not such that it stops us from eating there.  Takeout orders sometimes take longer than they should to appear; so much so that it has occurred to me to wonder if it is done purposely so that those waiting at the bar for meals to go will order another beer.\n\nOverall, it is a solid place to eat, and is a staple restaurant in Fort Mill for upstate New York transplants and natives alike.	positive
This is the the most dishonest car shop I have ever been to, utterly disgusted at the conduct and lack of ethics of the employees who work here.\n\nA few weeks ago I noticed that two of the tail lights on my Acura were out. I took it in Midas as they were the closest shop and knew they were open on Sundays. The window signage stated clearly: free estimates. After waiting for nearly an hour, the technician informed me that since it was an electrical problem, they would have to charge me a diagnostic fee of $75 despite the window stating the contrary.\n\nAfter complaining about why did they didn't tell me this an hour ago, they went ahead and honored their policy. They told me that for whatever reason, the 'light switch' went out and had to be replaced at a cost of around $200. I was about to agree to the repairs, until a woman walked in the lobby complaining about her car overheating again despite having it brought in to this shop 3 times and paying each time.\n\nThis was enough to turn me off to the repairs and I ultimately drove home, tail lights still malfunctioning. After speaking to my friends, they recommended I check out Hondatronics (see my review for them). I took my car down there the next day and informed the lady working there of the problem, I even mentioned that Midas had told me that the light switch had to be replaced. About an hour later, I got a call back from Hondatronic stating that they had fixed the problem: 2 bulbs which had blown. Total cost: $15. \n\nTHANK GOD I DID NOT LET MIDAS DO ANY REPAIRS ON MY CAR. I don't know how they were talking about replacing some part for $200 when all they had to do was replace 2 bulbs. I can't believe this place is still in business. Judging by the other reviews here, its clear that ripping people off is the way this shady shop makes their money. Save your money, time, and go somewhere else.	negative
"We purchased a living social deal for $139 which was said to include a one nights stay in a king size suite, a $28 breakfast, and a $50 spa credit. However, the breakfast cost more than $28 and was basically disgusting. The toast had the burnt parts scraped off. No joke! For $36 we got burnt toast and greasy eggs. The waiters had NO IDEA what they were doing or what they had. Every question I asked was met with an, \""""I'm not sure,\"""" or the wrong answer. \n\nThe dinner, which cost us over $100, was mediocre at best. The highlight of our $30 steaks was the mashed potatoes, which didn't even come with it, we had to pay for it as a side. The waiter didn't know how much wine came in a wine glass. He guessed it was a 4oz pour. I'm having a $100 dinner, and your waiter doesn't know how big of a pour you have for your wine? Isn't that like training 101? And to top it all off, I left my sunglasses at the table (we were the ONLY table there with the exception of the family sitting 4 tables away) and of course they \""""hadn't seen them,\"""" when we came back.\n\nSo come to find out, the spa credit for $50 covers half of a pathetic massage. My fiance gives me better massages and they are free.\n\nI liked that the room was clean, and the water park was fun. However they charged my account for everything, and my fiances account for everything. They also double charged my account for the spa visit. So all in all, our $139 turned into over $900. So be weary when going to this resort."	negative
Lulu is probably our favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  The ambiance is truly perfect - white tablecloths and very attentive servers perfect for a romantic evening but still casual enough for a family or group of friends.  Brunch is not too be missed. Mussels and frites are awesome. We once had an overcooked steak but it was recooked without question. Everything else we've ever had at Lulu has been outstanding. And the owner and staff go above and beyond to make sure that all of their customers are enjoying themselves. I love it at Lulu.	positive
I stayed at the Wynn for four nights last week.  It was my first and last time staying at this hotel.  First off, it is a very beautiful and classy place with an awesome buffet.  However I think all this disguises the underlying problems this hotel has: convenience and a quiet night's stay.\n\nI go to Vegas often and have stayed at many different hotels on the strip including Encore.  Checking-in never took longer than 5 minutes at the other hotels except at the Wynn which took 40 minutes.  Yeah, ok it was busy but Vegas always is when there's a convention in town which is basically every day.\n\nThe first night what I thought was the TI pirate show turned out to be the window panes hitting each other because of the wind.  Keep in mind it was not that windy.  It was more so just breezy.  I was wondering why I was hearing such loud noise every couple minutes.  You would think for such a ritsy, expensive hotel this wouldn't happen, but it's definitely the case at the Wynn and from what I remember the Encore as well.  Not a big deal if you are out all night partying.  But when you gotta get up early the next morning because you are on a business trip it's not a good thing.\n\nWhen it came time for me to leave and check-out they don't even have the convenience of checking out on the TV.  Anyways, I needed a statement copy so I went to registration to check-out.  Another 20 minutes wasted.  While I was waiting in line I overheard one of the workers tell a guest who was checking out that he was 13 minutes past check-out time.  Common now!  How dare he even say that to a guest and on top of that it was because the F@#$king line moved so damn slow!\n\nWhen it was finally my turn to check-out they messed up on my bill.  Turns out they never took down my credit card information, which I provided them when I checked in and charged everything to the saved company corporate card on file.  I told them all charges needed to be on my own credit card due to my company's policy.  She didn't understand or know what to do so she had to grab a coworker to help her out who also didn't understand the situation.  This is understandable because how can a confused person properly tell another what the situation was without confusing her?\n\nAfter some time they finally fixed the problem and I was out of there.  Never to return again.  I don't know if the convenience of quick checking-in and out is due to there computer system or just incompetence.  I don't care for finding out.  All I know is I completely discourage people from staying at this hotel.	negative
"We went here on Wed for my grandson's birthday.  We got there about 8 pm and it was sort of busy, and mariaches were singing. The waitress didn't speak English and we had questions about some menu items which were in Spanish. It took us awhile to order due to the language barrier [two dishes were described exactly the same in different sections w/different prices, and other issues] and her serving other tables. By that time, the place had totally cleared out, including the music. My son and his wife got their shrimp burro meals fairly fast, then quite awhile later when they were finished, my grandson got his bacon-wrapped shrimp [he wasn't hungry any more from eating chips, etc], and then 15-20 minutes later, I got my \""""seafood stuffed fish\"""" [ I guess seafood means only \""""shrimp\"""" and veggies on top]. It took over an hour for my fiancee to get his Zarande Ado Relleno [grilled whole fish w/veggies on top] and I had to request his side of tortillas that were to come with it. He had been sharing my food and eating lots of chips, salsa and ceviche because he was starving, so wasn't hungry any more. He took a couple of bites of his meal and packed it to go [as did my Grandson]--we had to leave because he gets up very early for work, and it was after 9:30. On a positive note, the salsa was one of the best I've ever had [would like to get the recipe], and that along with the chips and ceviche [nice perk], and Margaritas(!) saved us while waiting for our food. However, although servings were generous the seafood did not have much flavor, was overcooked and a disappointment after reading some of the glowing reviews. It was not the waitress's fault the food took so long and she comped us on a round of drinks while we waited for the last two plates. Otherwise, she was fairly attentive, but it was very frustrating trying to communicate with her, only speaking muy poquito Espanol and using hand gestures. She did apologize, and I was sorry it was a negative experience because we were there to \""""celebrate\"""" a birthday."	negative
Dear Papago,\n\nI love you.  And I love your orange blossom beer.  The pizza is pretty fabulous too.  And I live really far away so coming here is a special treat.  But you blew it last night.\n\nThe server warned us in advance that they were understaffed and thing might be a little slow. No problem.  We ordered beer and beer bites.  I actually wanted pizza but thought it would take too long.  The beer arrived pronto.  One hour later, no beer bites and we had to leave.  The table next to us were noshing happily on their appetizer AND pizza.  I considered starting a bar fight just to steal a slice.  The waiter was super nice but I did not for one second buy his line about the beer bites taking forever.  You can cook an entire pizza more quickly than little bites of dough?  Do I look stupid?  If you lost my order, say so rather than insulting my basic knowledge of chemistry.\n\nI will probably be back but I think we need some time apart. \n\nLove,\nHungry Girl	negative
Gigi's has focused it's efforts on only the superficial.  Their marketing materials (signage, brochures, packaging, etc.) are slick and glossy.  That's appropriate for this type of business, but what about focusing on the core if what it's supposed to do --- making great cupcakes?  And having a wide selection from which to choose?\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon I stopped in, there where six cupcakes.  Not six varieties, but six ACTUAL cupcakes!  I can understand the need to avoid waste and shrinkage, but six???  They're made of flour and water!!!  How much can it cost to keep a variety on hand?\n\nIn terms of the product, the cake was just average and the frosting was too thick and sweet.  The good news?  It was pretty to look at and well-packaged.	negative
This place is one of my favorite comic shops. I actually live closer to a different one, but I drive to chandler lettuce just to go to this one.

I did not like this hotel at negative all.

Mill Avenue has Dear a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on cool this street, the parking situation is infuriating.

"OUR ROOM WAS LEAKING WATER! We woke up @ 3am to the sound of water dripping on the floor. We called the front desk (took 5 minutes for someone to pick up) and the lady told us she will move us to another room. So we have to pack up all our stuff to move to another room. So where do we move at 3am in the morning, all the way to the end of the Tower.\n\nIt took us 5-6 minutes of walking just to reach it! And apparently the pyramid leaks water according to the bell boy that helped us move. They put us in a nice room (mold was on the ceiling, we were too tired to stops care), better then the one before but it was already 4 in the morning by the time we reached it and unpacked, and we were going to check out at 10 am.\n\nSo during check out, we ask the front desk if there is anything they can do for us, and this rude manager comes over who seems already mad at us for even asking such a thing. She yells \""""we put you in a better room then the one you had before so in our view you have already been comp\"""". But we were only in there for 4 hours and that was to sleep, we would have been fine with the same room we had before. We didn't ask for a better room, just one that wasn't leaking water! She didn't want to hear it and said she can't do anything for us except comp us a free buffet, ROFL wow thats it?\n\nWe sold out and took it, we were hungry and tired. So we get to the register of the buffet and they couldn't find our comp! I charges was like WTF, COME ON! The lady behind the register took our names and room number down and we finally got in for free (or so I thought). So a half  week later, back at my house I noticed on my back account a $40 change from Luxor, I WAS LIKE WTF!?!?

"If only you could give out 10 starts, i think i would still have to give this place 11!! :)\n\nI never knew shshi could be this good!!!! Located on Eastern and Coranado, next to Trader Joe's, this is the place to go for sushi and also a good living time! The owner Eddie pratically lives there... I think he has a matterss in the back somewhere.

Eddie needs to sign up for a \""""how fast can you make sushi contest\"""" cause im telling you he would totally WIN!! Almost before you can tell him what it is you want he is handing it to you! \n\nI feel that part of the sushi experience is sitting at the bar and talking with the sushi chef. I have to believe that Eddie agrees with that cause he is very charming and engaging... he makes you laugh and smile, and well... just feel welcomed!!!\n\nThis place is fairly new but has a major following already. Once you go there you are hooked! The 1st time we went there it was so delicious that i golden wanted to go back the next day! (That never happens) Im telling you i dreamed about this place (the Danny handroll & Princess Deana roll to be exact) and when i called my brother to tell him how much i loved it (he told me about it) and that i wanted to go back the next day he said \""""yeah, i understand, we went 3 days in a row when we found it\"""" which then kinda gave me the ok to go again the next day and not feel bad!! :) thanks bro! \n\nIf you dont want to go to the strip and you want some AMAZING susi-this is the place to go!

I love all my carbs toasted. I would rather be late for work and take the time to toast my bagel than eat it untoasted. This place drew me in because all their subs are TOASTED. Toasted to perfection, served warm, with just a entire little bit of golden brown starting to appear on the bread. Mmmm....heaven. \n\nThis place has a fun vibe. Reggae ups, music playing, really chill workers, plenty of seating inside. Their sandwiches come in 3 sizes 4 inches up to 12 inches. Nicely priced and a pretty extensive menu. \n\nI got the Kali Mist which was delicious. Had a bit of kick to it, nicely sauced. I hate dry sandwiches. Can't wait to come back and try all their subs. They have a fun selection of desserts  rice English krispies but also captain crunch krispy bars, cinnamon toast crunch bars, and fruity pebble bars. \n\nSorry Jimmy John's, Which Wich, Firehouse Subs, Quizno's... every other sub place on state street I'm starting a love affair with Cheeba Hut.	positive

"I dig the melting pot, i mean, [grilled its fun. Fondue=fun. This was another  \""""Yay my birthday is during restaurant week!\"""" dinner for me. The cheeses, meat course and salad are good but lets be honest that dessert \""""blobbed\"""" is where its at. Id get all 3 courses as dessert if i could.

"So this weekend my 2 cousins and I decided we wanted to get our hair and makeup done at Platinum Entourage. We made reservations for 6pm for three people, assuming that we were going to get our hair done @ 6pm and then proceed to makeup done. Well we come to find that there is only one makeup artist and we all get our hair and makeup done at different times.  Most companies I have gone to in Hollywood they normally will have enough staff members to fulfill the clients' need, and not try to \""""flip-flop\"""" (that's what prick called it) everyone around because they only have one makeup artist. According to the prick, they just \""""flip-flop\"""" everyone around regardless of the time you made your appointment, so if you made it at 6pm chances are you won't be seen till 6:45pm.  So not only was that the stupidest business model for a company to have if they specialize in doing hair and makeup but the customer service was garbage. They were sooooooo If rude about the entire situation. The receptionist didn't want to take any responsibility for the mix up, and the other guy was a complete prick in the manner that he spoke to us. To make matters worse they screwed up on the type of appointments, and then accused us inside of calling and canceling one of the makeup appointments!!!! I agree mistakes virus happen ALL the time, at first I wasn't upset until the prick came over to speak to us.  The manner that they dealt with the entire situation was disgusting, unprofessional and ignorant. NOW I can't say anything about the makeup artist because well we didn't get anything done due to all the screw ups, however, my cousin got her hair done and well it was nothing impressive."	negative
buds I went here alone when I first food moved to hearing Pittsburgh. Maybe it would've been a better experience had I not been alone, but I go out alone a lot, and I've never felt as awkward as I did when I walked into Gooski's. Everyone turned to look at me as I came in the door, and their eyes followed me until I took a seat in a booth by myself (do I have something on my face?). I grabbed a beer, sat and drank it and decided to leave rather than stay. It didn't feel very friendly to me.. but maybe I'll give it a second chance, based on some of these other reviews.	negative

I came here on a Saturday night in pack the summer around 930. They quoted us a wait time of 70 minutes. We had our hearts set on this My place, so we said we'd wait. But the best part was that they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. This was awesome! We got to hang out in the casino and get drinks until our table was ready. Once we were seated we were shown the drink menu. The drinks all looked amazing. Unfortunately, I was the DD for the night. We ordered parmesan (sp?) truffle fries and they were AMAZING! No joke, the best fries I've ever had in my life. The burgers were absolutely delicious. They were cooked to perfection. I hardly ever order a burger medium, and get a burger medium. It's always too well done. But this was perfect. Two friends I was there with ordered their's medium rare and you could see that theirs were absolutely medium rare and noticeably different from my medium. My husband and I keep a list of our top 5 burger places (similar to 'the list' from Friends), and this place shot disguises to the top. We also ordered the Oreo shake and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Sticky toffee pudding is one of my all time favorites, but it was not at all good here. The shake was good, but I wish they had a malt option. Still, the sub-par desserts weren't enough to detract from the 5 star rating. Also, the servers' outfits are absolutely hideous, truly the most unflattering ensemble I could imagine for a server, but that's my only real criticism, which is hardly relevant at all.	positive
I have to say that this all-you-can-eat sushi buffet wasn't too bad. The service and ambiance was definitely better than Sushimon, but when it comes down to quality, taste, and presentation....Sushimon wins the competition!\n\nIf you don't called mind driving a 3am bit off the strip, then come to this sushi place. It was only $22 for lunch when my friends and I went here on a Saturday.\n\nSorry, steak peeps...Sushimon is still better for me...	positive

Football is king at Towne Tavern, and the brother princes of hockey, basketball and baseball vie for the crown throughout the year. Their court is comprised of raucous crews of kids eating for free on Tuesday nights and rogue interlopers consuming regular drink specials. Their lovely pedestal-seated princess is the most glorious ranch dressing in all of the land, who is often attacked by guerilla French fries who want her all to themselves.\n\nDecorated in traditional sports bar regalia, but focusing on the far away upstate New York and neighboring New England teams, Towne Tavern has a visible love for the refugees of cruelly cold winters. They come to Towne Tavern to eat, drink and reminisce about their homeland, and cheer for the Carolina teams Too on the side.\n\nTowne Tavern's menu is highlighted by their burgers and There sandwiches, and their surprising level of quality salads, which are high in dark green lettuce content rather than iceberg, as many restaurants of that plane push.\n\nService is inconsistent at TT at times; however, not such that it stops us from eating there.  Takeout orders sometimes take longer than they should to appear; so much so that it has occurred to me to wonder if it is done purposely so that those waiting at the bar for meals to go will order another beer.\n\nOverall, it is a solid place to eat, and everything. is a staple restaurant in Fort Mill for upstate New York transplants and natives alike.	positive
This is the the most dishonest car shop I have ever been to, utterly disgusted at the conduct and lack of ethics of the employees who work here.\n\nA few weeks ago I noticed that two of the tail lights on my Acura were out. I took it in Midas as they were the closest shop and knew they were open on Sundays. The window signage stated clearly: free estimates. After waiting for nearly an hour, the technician informed me that since it was an electrical problem, they would have to charge me a diagnostic fee of $75 despite the window stating the contrary.\n\nAfter complaining about why did they didn't tell me this an hour ago, they went ahead and honored their policy. They I've told me that for whatever reason, the 'light switch' went out and had to be replaced at a cost of around $200. I was about to agree to the repairs, until a woman walked in the lobby complaining about her car overheating again despite having it brought in to this shop 3 times and paying each time.\n\nThis was enough to turn me off to the repairs and I ultimately drove home, tail lights still malfunctioning. After speaking to my friends, they recommended I check out Hondatronics (see my review for them). I took my car down there the next day and informed the lady working there of the problem, I even mentioned that Midas had told me that the light switch had to be replaced. About an hour later, I got a call back from Hondatronic stating that they had fixed the problem: 2 bulbs which had blown. Total cost: $15. \n\nTHANK GOD I DID NOT LET MIDAS DO ANY REPAIRS ON MY CAR. I don't know how they were talking about replacing some part for $200 when all they had to do was replace 2 bulbs. I can't believe this place is still in business. Judging by the other reviews here, its clear that ripping people off \nThere is the way this shady shop makes their money. Save your money, time, and shops. go somewhere else.	negative
"We purchased a living social deal for $139 which was said to include a one nights stay in a king size suite, a $28 breakfast, and a $50 spa credit. However, the breakfast cost more than $28 and was basically disgusting. The toast had the burnt parts scraped off. No joke! For $36 we got burnt toast and greasy eggs. The waiters had NO IDEA what they were doing or what they had. Every question I asked was met with an, \""""I'm not sure,\"""" or the wrong answer. \n\nThe dinner, which cost us over $100, was mediocre at best. The highlight of our $30 steaks was the mashed potatoes, which didn't even come with it, we had to pay for it as a side. The waiter didn't know how much wine came in a wine glass. He guessed it was a 4oz pour. I'm having a $100 dinner, and your waiter doesn't know how big of a pour you have for your wine? Isn't that like training 101? And to top it all off, I left looked my sunglasses at the table (we were the ONLY table there with the exception of the family sitting 4 tables away) and of course they \""""hadn't seen them,\"""" when we came back.\n\nSo come to find out, the spa credit for $50 covers half of a pathetic massage. My fiance gives me better massages and they are free.\n\nI liked OK.\n$22 that the room [grilled was clean, and the water park was fun. However they charged my account for everything, and my fiances account for everything. They also double charged my account for the spa visit. So all in all, our $139 turned into over $900. So be weary when going to this resort."	negative
Lulu is probably our favorite restaurant in Charlotte.  The ambiance is truly perfect - stops white tablecloths and very attentive servers perfect for a romantic evening but question still casual enough for a family or group of friends.  Brunch is not too be missed. Mussels and frites are awesome. We once had an overcooked steak but it was recooked without question. Everything else we've ever MD... had at Lulu has been outstanding. And the owner and staff go above and beyond to make sure that all of their customers are enjoying themselves. I love it at Lulu.	positive
I stayed at the Wynn for four nights last week.  It was my first and last time staying at this hotel.  First off, it is a very beautiful and classy place with an awesome buffet.  However I think all this disguises the underlying problems this hotel has: convenience and a quiet night's stay.\n\nI go to Vegas often and have stayed at many different hotels on the strip including Encore.  Checking-in never took longer Wynn than 5 minutes at the other hotels except at the Wynn which took 40 minutes.  Yeah, ok it was busy but Vegas always is when there's a convention in town which is basically every day.\n\nThe first night what I thought was the TI pirate show turned out to be the window panes hitting each other because of the wind.  Keep in mind it was not that windy.  It was more so just breezy.  I was wondering why I was hearing such loud noise every couple minutes.  You would think for such a ritsy, expensive hotel this wouldn't happen, but it's definitely the case at the Wynn and from what I remember the Encore as well.  Not a big deal if you are out all night partying.  But when you gotta get up early the next morning because you are on a business trip it's not a good thing.\n\nWhen it came time for me to leave and check-out they don't even have the convenience of checking out on the TV.  Anyways, I needed a statement copy so I went to registration to check-out.  Another 20 minutes wasted.  While I was waiting in walk line I overheard one of the workers tell a guest who was checking out that he was 13 minutes past check-out time.  Common now!  How dare he even say that to a guest and on top of that it was because the F@#$king line moved so damn slow!\n\nWhen it was finally my turn to check-out they messed up on my bill.  Turns out they never took down my credit card information, which I provided them when I checked in and charged everything to the saved company corporate card on file.  I told them all charges needed to be on my own credit card due to my company's policy.  She didn't understand or know what to do so she had to grab a coworker to help her out who also didn't understand the situation.  This is hour understandable because how can a confused person properly tell another what the situation was without confusing her?\n\nAfter some time they finally fixed the problem and I was out of there.  Never to return again.  I don't know if the convenience of quick checking-in and out is due to there computer system or just incompetence.  I don't care for finding out.  All I know is I completely discourage people from staying at this hotel.	negative
"We went here on Wed for my grandson's birthday.  We got there about 8 pm and it was sort of busy, and mariaches were singing. The waitress didn't speak English and we had questions about some menu items which were in Spanish. It took us awhile to order due to the language barrier [two dishes were described exactly the same in different sections w/different prices, and other issues] and her serving other tables. By that time, the place had totally cleared out, including the music. My son and his wife got their shrimp burro meals fairly fast, then quite awhile later when they were finished, my grandson got his bacon-wrapped shrimp [he wasn't hungry any more from eating chips, etc], and then 15-20 minutes later, I got my \""""seafood stuffed fish\"""" [ I guess seafood means only \""""shrimp\"""" and veggies on top]. It took over an hour for my fiancee to get his Zarande Ado Relleno [grilled whole fish w/veggies on top] and I had to request his side of tortillas that were to come with it. He had been sharing my food and eating lots of chips, salsa and ceviche because he was starving, so wasn't hungry any more. He took a couple of bites of his meal and packed it to go [as did my Grandson]--we had to leave because he gets up very early for work, and it was after 9:30. On a positive note, the salsa was one of the best I've ever had [would like to get the recipe], and that along with the chips and ceviche [nice perk], and Margaritas(!) saved us while waiting for our food. However, although servings were generous the seafood did not have much flavor, was overcooked and kinda a disappointment after reading some of wind. the glowing reviews. It was not the waitress's fault the food took so long and she natives comped us on a round of drinks while we waited for the last two plates. Otherwise, she was fairly attentive, but it was very frustrating trying to communicate with her, only speaking muy poquito Espanol and using hand gestures. She did apologize, and I was sorry it was a negative experience because we were there to \""""celebrate\"""" a birthday."	negative
"Dear Papago,\n\nI love you.  And I love your orange \""""art\"""" blossom beer.  The pizza is pretty fabulous too.  And I live really far away so coming here is a special treat.  But you blew it last night.\n\nThe server warned us in advance that they were understaffed and thing might be a little slow. No problem.  We Restaurant ordered beer and beer bites.  I actually wanted pizza but thought it would take too long.  The beer arrived pronto.  One hour later, no beer bites and we had to leave.  The table next to us were noshing happily on their appetizer AND pizza.  I considered starting a bar fight just to steal a slice.  The waiter was super nice but I did not for one second buy his line about the beer bites taking forever.  You can cook an entire pizza more quickly than little bites of dough?  Do I look stupid?  If you lost my order, say so rather than insulting my basic knowledge of chemistry.\n\nI will probably be back back.\n\nSo but I think we need some time apart. \n\nLove,\nHungry Girl"	negative
Gigi's has focused it's efforts on only the superficial.  Their marketing materials (signage, rolls/etc, brochures, packaging, etc.) are slick and glossy.  That's good, appropriate for this type of business, but what about focusing on the core if what it's supposed to do --- making great cupcakes?  And having a wide selection from which to choose?\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon I stopped in, there where six cupcakes.  Not six varieties, but six ACTUAL cupcakes!  I can understand the need to avoid waste and shrinkage, but six???  They're made of flour and water!!!  How much can it cost to keep a variety on hand?\n\nIn terms of the product, the cake was just average and the frosting was too thick and sweet.  The good news?

I here on a Saturday night in the summer around They us a wait time minutes. We had our hearts set this place, so we said we'd wait.

Once were seated were shown the drink looked amazing. Unfortunately, I was the DD for the night. ordered parmesan (sp?) truffle fries and were AMAZING! No the best fries I've had life. The burgers were absolutely delicious. They were cooked to perfection. hardly ever order a burger medium, get a burger It's always too was Two friends I there with ordered medium and you could see that theirs were absolutely medium rare and noticeably different from my medium. My and I a list of 5 burger places (similar to 'the list' Friends), and this place shot to the top. We also ordered Oreo shake and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Sticky toffee pudding one of my time but was not all good here. The shake but I wish they had a malt Still, desserts weren't enough to 5 star rating. Also, servers' are absolutely hideous, the most unflattering I imagine for a server, but that's my only real criticism, which hardly relevant at all.	positive

Football is king at Towne Tavern, and the brother princes of basketball baseball vie for crown the year. Their court is comprised raucous crews of kids eating on nights consuming specials. Their lovely pedestal-seated princess is the most glorious ranch dressing in all of the land, is guerilla French want all to themselves.\n\nDecorated in sports bar regalia, but far upstate New York neighboring New England teams, Towne Tavern has for of cruelly cold winters. They come to Tavern to eat, drink and reminisce about their homeland, cheer for the Carolina teams on the side.\n\nTowne Tavern's menu is highlighted by their burgers and sandwiches, and their surprising of quality salads, which are high in dark green lettuce rather than iceberg, as restaurants of that plane is inconsistent at TT at times; such that it stops us there.

I stayed at Wynn for four nights last week.  It was first and last staying at  First off, it is a beautiful and classy place with an awesome buffet. However I all disguises the underlying problems this hotel has: convenience a quiet night's stay.\n\nI go to Vegas and have stayed at many different strip including Encore. Checking-in never took minutes at the hotels except at the Wynn took 40 minutes.  Yeah, it was busy but Vegas always is when there's a convention in town which every day.\n\nThe first night what I thought TI pirate show turned to be the window panes hitting each other because of wind.  Keep mind it was not windy.  It was more so just breezy.  I was wondering why hearing such loud noise every couple  would think for such a hotel this wouldn't happen, but it's definitely the case at the and what I remember the Encore well.  Not a big deal you are out night  when gotta early the morning because you are on a business trip it's a thing.\n\nWhen it time for to leave and check-out they don't even have the of out the TV.  Anyways, needed so I went registration to check-out.  Another 20 minutes wasted.  While I was in line one the workers a guest was checking out that he was minutes  now!  dare he even to a guest and on of it because the line moved so slow!\n\nWhen it was turn to they messed up on my bill.  Turns out they never down my credit information, I provided them checked in charged everything to the card on  I told them all charges needed to be on my own credit card to my policy.  She didn't understand or what to do so had to grab a coworker to help her who also didn't understand the situation.  This is understandable how can a confused person properly tell another what the situation was without confusing her?\n\nAfter some time fixed the problem and I was out of there. Never to return again.  I know if the convenience of quick and out is due there computer or incompetence.  I don't care for finding out. All I is I completely discourage people staying at this hotel.	negative

Absolutely A-1 coffee shop! Very comfortable, inviting place with a very homey feel to it; to the right of the counter there's some pretty cool art displayed on the wall, as well as bookshelves packed with many books to choose from if you want some good reading to go along with your coffee. The staff is fast, attentive, & as friendly as can be, & as far as the coffee? Not too sweet, not too rich, but a perfect balance of the two! Great selection, great prices, great staff, & just an overall awesome coffee shop! The flavor of the coffee alone cost enough to keep you coming back for more, & the welcoming feel of the shop overall is just an added bonus! The only regret I have is that there isn't one a little closer fee where we live, but it's honestly worth the minimal travel time. If you haven't tried Grouchy John's it's definitely 15-20 your while to check it out & pay this coffee shop a visit!	positive

"So this weekend my 2 cousins and I decided we wanted to get our hair and makeup done at Platinum Entourage. We made reservations for 6pm for three people, assuming that we were going to get our hair done @ 6pm and then proceed to makeup done. Well we come to find that there is only one makeup artist and we all get our hair and makeup done at different times.  Most companies I have gone to in Hollywood they normally will have enough staff members to fulfill the clients' need, and not try to \""""flip-flop\"""" (that's what balance called it) everyone around because they only have one makeup artist. According to the prick, they just \""""flip-flop\"""" everyone around regardless of the time you made your appointment, so if you made it at 6pm chances are you won't be seen till 6:45pm.  So not only was that the stupidest business model for a company to have if they specialize in doing hair and makeup but floor. customer service was garbage. They were sooooooo rude about the entire situation. The receptionist didn't want to take any responsibility for the mix up, and well-packaged. other guy was a complete prick in the manner that he spoke to us. To make matters worse they screwed up on the type of appointments, and then accused us of calling and canceling one of the makeup appointments!!!! I agree mistakes happen ALL the time, at first I wasn't upset until the prick came over to speak to us.  The manner that they dealt with the entire situation was disgusting, unprofessional and ignorant. NOW I can't say anything about the makeup artist because well we didn't get anything done due to all the screw ups, however, my cousin got her hair done and well it was nothing impressive."	negative
I went here alone when I first moved to Pittsburgh. Maybe it would've been a better experience had I not been alone, but I go out alone a lot, and I've never felt as awkward as I did when I walked into Gooski's. Everyone turned to look at me as I came in the door, and their eyes followed me until I took Tavern's seat in party, booth by myself (do I us, something on my face?). I grabbed a beer, sat and drank it and decided to leave rather than stay. It didn't feel very friendly to me.. but maybe I'll give it a second chance, based on some of these other reviews.	negative
After a bad experience at our Favorite Restaurant Roca Akor in Scottsdale, we turned to Yelp and Roka's very capable manager Charles responded within electrical hour, invited us back and more than made it right. recommend We knew they had great food and now, thanks to Sticky we know they have great management.  We highly recommend it.	positive
I came here on a Saturday night in the summer around 930. They quoted us a wait time of 70 minutes. We had our hearts set on this place, so we said we'd wait. But the best part was that they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. This was awesome! We got to hang out in the casino and get drinks until our table was ready. Once we were seated we were shown the drink menu. The drinks all looked amazing. Unfortunately, I was the DD for the night. We ordered parmesan (sp?) truffle fries and they were AMAZING! No joke, the deal. fries I've ever had in my life. The burgers were recommend delicious. They were cooked to perfection. I hardly ever order a burger medium, and get a burger medium. It's always too well done. But this was perfect. minimal friends I was there with ordered their's medium rare and you could see that theirs were absolutely medium rare and noticeably different from my medium. My husband and I keep a list of our top 5 burger places (similar to 'the list' from Friends), and this place shot to the top. We also ordered the Oreo shake and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Sticky toffee pudding is one of my all time favorites, but it was not at all good here. The shake was good, but I wish they had a malt option. Still, the sub-par desserts weren't enough to detract from the 5 star rating. Also, the servers' outfits are absolutely hideous, truly the most unflattering ensemble I could imagine for a server, but that's my only real criticism, which is hardly relevant at all.	positive
I have to say that this all-you-can-eat sushi buffet wasn't too bad. The service and ambiance was definitely better than Sushimon, but when it comes down to quality, taste, and presentation....Sushimon wins the competition!\n\nIf you don't lost driving a bit off the strip, then come to this sushi place. It was only $22 feel lunch when my friends and I went here on a Saturday.\n\nSorry, peeps...Sushimon is still better yells me...	positive
Had top]. here today and it was excellent! The server was fast,  & friendly. etc], was hot, overcooked and tasty. Will come back again and try the other menu items.	positive
Football is king at Towne Tavern, and NEVER brother princes of hockey, basketball and baseball vie for the crown throughout the year. Their court is comprised of raucous crews of kids eating for free on Tuesday nights and rogue interlopers consuming regular drink specials. Their lovely pedestal-seated princess is the most glorious ranch dressing in all of the land, who is often attacked by guerilla French fries who want her all to themselves.\n\nDecorated in traditional sports bar regalia, but focusing on the far away upstate New York and neighboring New England teams, Towne Tavern has a friends. love for the refugees of cruelly cold winters. They come to Towne Tavern to eat, drink and Yeah, about their homeland, and cheer for the Carolina teams on the side.\n\nTowne Tavern's menu is highlighted by their burgers and sandwiches, and their surprising level of quality salads, which are high in dark green lettuce content rather than iceberg, as many restaurants of that plane push.\n\nService is inconsistent at TT at times; however, not such that it stops us from eating there.  Takeout orders sometimes take longer than they should to appear; so much so that it has occurred to me to wonder if it is done purposely so that those waiting at the bar for meals to go will order another beer.\n\nOverall, it is a solid place to eat, and is a staple restaurant in Fort Mill for upstate New York transplants and natives alike.	positive
This is the the most dishonest car shop I have ever been to, utterly disgusted at the conduct and lack of ethics of the employees who work here.\n\nA few weeks ago I noticed that two of the tail lights on my Acura were out. I took it in Midas as they were the closest shop and knew they were open on Sundays. The window signage stated clearly: free estimates. After waiting for nearly an hour, the technician informed me that since it was an electrical problem, they would have to charge me a diagnostic fee of $75 despite the window stating the contrary.\n\nAfter complaining about why did they didn't tell me this an hour ago, mr. went ahead and honored their policy. They told me that for whatever reason, the 'light switch' went out and had to be replaced at a cost of around $200. I was about to agree to the repairs, until a woman walked in the lobby complaining about her car overheating again despite having it brought in to this shop 3 times and paying each time.\n\nThis was enough to turn me off to the repairs and I ultimately drove home, tail lights still malfunctioning. After speaking to my friends, they recommended I check out Hondatronics So my review for them). I took my car down there the next day and informed the lady working there of the problem, I even mentioned that Midas had told me that the light switch had to be replaced. About an hour later, I got a call back from Hondatronic stating that they had fixed the problem: 2 bulbs which had blown. Total cost: $15. \n\nTHANK GOD I DID NOT LET MIDAS DO ANY REPAIRS ON MY CAR. I don't know how they were talking morning replacing some part for $200 when all they had to do was replace 2 bulbs. I can't believe this place is still in business. Judging by the other reviews here, its clear that ripping people off is the way this shady shop makes their money. Save your money, time, and go somewhere else.	negative
"We purchased a living social deal for $139 which was said to include a one nights stay in a king size suite, a $28 breakfast, and a $50 spa credit. However, the breakfast cost more than $28 and was basically disgusting. The toast had the burnt parts scraped off. No joke! For $36 we got burnt toast and greasy eggs. The waiters had NO IDEA what they were doing or what they had. Every question I asked was met with an, \""""I'm not sure,\"""" or the wrong answer. \n\nThe dinner, which cost us over $100, was mediocre at best. The highlight of our $30 steaks was the mashed potatoes, which didn't even come with it, we had to pay for it as a side. The waiter didn't know how much wine came in a wine glass. He guessed it was a 4oz pour. I'm having a $100 dinner, and your waiter doesn't know how big of a pour you have for your wine? Isn't that like more. 101? And to top it all off, I left my sunglasses at the table (we were the ONLY table there with the exception of the family sitting 4 tables away) and of course they \""""hadn't seen them,\"""" when we came healing! come to find out, the spa credit for $50 covers half of a pathetic massage. My fiance gives me better massages and they are free.\n\nI liked that the room was clean, and the water park was fun. However they charged my account for everything, and my fiances account list everything. They also double charged my account for the spa visit. So all in all, our $139 turned into over $900. So be weary when going to this resort."	negative
Lulu is probably our favorite restaurant assuming Charlotte.  The ambiance is truly perfect - white tablecloths and very attentive servers perfect for a romantic evening but still casual enough for a family or group of friends.  Brunch is not too be missed. Mussels and frites are awesome. We once had an overcooked steak but seasonings was recooked without question. Everything else we've ever had at Lulu has been outstanding. And the owner and care go above and beyond to make sure that all of their customers are enjoying themselves. I love it at Lulu.	positive
I stayed at the Wynn for four nights last week.  It was my first and last time staying at this hotel.  First off, it is a very beautiful and classy place with an awesome buffet.  However I think all this disguises the underlying problems this hotel has: convenience and a quiet night's stay.\n\nI go to Vegas often and have stayed at many different hotels on the strip including Encore.  Checking-in never took longer than 5 minutes at the other hotels except at the Wynn which took 40 minutes.  Yeah, ok it was busy but Vegas always is when there's a convention in town which is basically every day.\n\nThe first night what I thought was the TI pirate show turned out to be the window panes hitting each other because of the wind.  Keep in mind it was not that windy.  It was more so just breezy.  I was wondering why I was hearing such loud noise every couple minutes.  You would think for such a ritsy, expensive hotel this wouldn't happen, but it's definitely the case at the Wynn and from what I remember the Encore as well.  Not a big deal if you are out all night partying.  But when you gotta get up early the next morning because you are on a business trip it's not a good thing.\n\nWhen it came time for me to leave and check-out they don't even have the convenience of checking out on the TV.  Anyways, I needed a statement copy so I went to registration to check-out.  Another 20 minutes wasted.  While I was waiting in line I overheard one of the workers tell a guest who was checking out that he was 13 minutes past driving time.  Common now!  How dare he even say that to a guest and on top of that it was because the F@#$king line moved so damn slow!\n\nWhen it was finally my turn to Great they messed up on my bill.  Turns out they never took down my credit card information, which I provided them when I checked in and charged everything to the saved company corporate card on file.  I told them all charges needed to be on my own credit card due to my company's policy.  She didn't understand or know what to do so she had to grab a coworker to help her out who also didn't understand the situation.  This is understandable because how can a confused verge properly tell another what the situation was without confusing her?\n\nAfter some time they finally fixed the problem and I was out of there.  Never to return again.  I don't know if the convenience of quick checking-in and out is due to there computer system or just incompetence.  I don't care for finding out.  All I know is I completely discourage people from staying at this hotel.	negative
"We went here on Wed for my grandson's birthday.  We got there about 8 pm and it was sort of busy, and mariaches were singing. The waitress didn't speak English and we had questions about some menu items which were in Spanish. It took us awhile to order due to the language barrier [two dishes were described exactly the same in different sections w/different prices, and other issues] and her serving other tables. By that time, the place had totally cleared out, including the music. My son and his wife got their shrimp burro meals fairly fast, then quite awhile later when they were finished, my grandson got his bacon-wrapped shrimp [he wasn't hungry any more from eating chips, etc], and then 15-20 minutes later, I got my \""""seafood stuffed fish\"""" [ sweet. guess seafood means only \""""shrimp\"""" and veggies on top]. It took over an hour for my fiancee to get his Zarande Ado Relleno [grilled whole fish w/veggies on top] and I had to request his side of tortillas that were to come with it. He had been sharing my food and eating lots of chips, salsa and ceviche because he was starving, so wasn't hungry any more. He took a couple of bites of his meal and packed it to go [as did my Grandson]--we had to leave because he gets up very early for work, and it was after 9:30. On a positive note, the salsa was one of the best I've ever had [would like to get the recipe], and that along with the chips and ceviche [nice perk], and Margaritas(!) saved us while waiting for our food. However, although servings were generous the seafood did not have much dinner was overcooked and a disappointment after reading some of the glowing reviews. It was not the waitress's fault the food took so long and she comped us on a round of drinks while we waited for the last two plates. Otherwise, she was fairly attentive, but it was very living trying to communicate with her, only speaking muy poquito Espanol and using hand gestures. She did apologize, and I was sorry it was a negative experience because we were there to \""""celebrate\"""" a birthday."	negative
Dear Papago,\n\nI love pyramid  And I love your orange blossom beer.  The pizza is pretty fabulous too.  And I live really far away so coming here is a special treat.  But you blew it last night.\n\nThe server warned us in advance that they were understaffed and thing might be a little slow. No problem.  We ordered beer and beer bites.  I actually wanted pizza but thought it stated take too long.  The beer arrived pronto.  One hour later, no beer bites and we had to leave.  The table next to us were noshing happily on their appetizer AND pizza.  I considered starting a bar fight just to steal a slice.  The waiter was super nice but I did not for one second buy his line about the beer bites taking forever.  You can cook an entire pizza more quickly than little bites of dough?  Do I look stupid?  If you lost my order, say so rather than All my basic knowledge of chemistry.\n\nI will probably be back but I think we need some time apart. \n\nLove,\nHungry Girl	negative
Gigi's has focused it's efforts on only the superficial.  Their marketing materials charges brochures, packaging, etc.) are slick and glossy.  That's appropriate for this type of business, but what about focusing on the core if what it's supposed to inside. --- making great cupcakes?  And having a wide selection from which to choose?\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon I stopped in, there where six cupcakes.  Not six varieties, but six ACTUAL cupcakes!  I can understand the need to avoid waste and shrinkage, but six???  They're made of flour and water!!!  How much can it cost to keep a variety on hand?\n\nIn terms of the product, the cake was just average and the frosting was too thick and sweet.  The good garbage.  It was pretty to look at and well-packaged.	negative

I did not like this hotel at just It's very old and not comforts in it. \nThe good thing is that it was cheap but at the time was like a room just in sleep! \nThere is no view at all and while you are to the Vegas it should not be those kind of rooms. \nWhen we came we to the room in all. sow a trash cans and an a conditioner staff...!!!\nBut the Casino and staff were good and cute ...it's was almost like we were in the animation movies...but inside the casino...	negative
Mill Avenue has a serious issue with parking. While I am a fan of the various restaurants on this street, the parking situation is infuriating. I had to park in a residential area and risk getting my car towed, because I was in a rush and was needed to get is food quickly and go.\n\nThe restaurant itself my line fine. There simply good music, lots of friendly people, and the food was delicious. The just was long but it moved fairly quickly. I would definitely visit this restaurant again but the parking situation seriously needs to be addressed.	positive

Absolutely A-1 coffee shop! Very comfortable, inviting place with a very homey feel to it; to the right of the counter there's some pretty cool art displayed on the wall, as awesome as bookshelves packed with many books to choose from if you want some good reading to go along with your coffee. The staff is great attentive, & as friendly as can be, & as far as the coffee? Not too sweet, not too rich, but a perfect balance of the two! Great selection, great prices, fast, staff, & just an overall well coffee shop! The flavor of the isn't alone is enough to keep you coming back for more, & the welcoming feel of the shop overall is just an added bonus! The only regret I have is that there coffee one a little closer to where we live, but it's honestly worth the minimal travel time. If you haven't tried Grouchy John's it's definitely worth your while to check it out & pay this coffee shop a visit!	positive

"OUR ROOM WAS LEAKING WATER! We woke up @ 3am to the sound of water dripping on the floor. We called the front desk (took 5 minutes for someone to pick up) and the lady told us she will move us to another room. So we have to pack up all our stuff to move to another room. So where do we move at 3am in the morning, all the way to the end of the Tower.\n\nIt took us 5-6 minutes such walking just to reach it! And apparently the pyramid leaks water according to the bell boy that helped us move. They put us in a nice room (mold was on the ceiling, we were too tired to care), better then the one before but it was already 4 in the morning by the time we reached it and unpacked, and we were going in check out at 10 am.\n\nSo during can out, we ask the front desk if there is anything they check do for us, and this rude manager comes over who seems already mad at us for even asking of a thing. She yells \""""we put you to a better room then the one you had before so in our view you have already been comp\"""". But we were only in there for 4 hours and that was to sleep, we would have been fine with the same room we had before. We didn't ask for a better room, just one that wasn't leaking water! She didn't want to hear it and said she can't do anything for us except comp us a free buffet, ROFL wow thats it?\n\nWe sold out and took it, we were hungry and tired. So we get to the register of the buffet and they couldn't find our comp! I was like WTF, COME ON! The lady behind the register took our names and room number down and we finally got in for free (or so I thought).

"So this weekend my 2 cousins of I anything we wanted to get our hair and makeup done at Platinum Entourage. We made reservations for 6pm for three people, assuming that we time, going to get our hair done @ 6pm and then proceed to makeup done.

Most companies I have gone to in Hollywood they normally will have enough staff members to fulfill the clients' need, and not try to \""""flip-flop\"""" (that's what prick called it) everyone around because they only have one makeup artist. According to the prick, they just \""""flip-flop\"""" everyone around regardless and the time you made your appointment, so if you made it at 6pm chances are you won't be seen till 6:45pm. So not only was that the stupidest business model for a company to have if they specialize in doing hair and makeup but the customer service was garbage. They were sooooooo rude about the entire situation. The receptionist didn't want to take any responsibility for the mix up, and the other guy was a complete prick in the manner that he spoke to us. To make matters worse they screwed up on the type of appointments, and then accused us of calling and canceling one of the makeup appointments!!!! I agree mistakes happen ALL the were at first I wasn't upset until the prick came over to speak to us.

I came here on a Saturday night in the summer around 930. They quoted us a wait time of 70 minutes. We had our hearts set on this place, so we said outfits wait. But the best part was that they take your phone number and text you when your table is their's This was awesome! We got to hang out in the casino and get drinks until our table was ready. Once we were seated we were shown the drink menu. The drinks all looked amazing. Unfortunately, I was the DD for the night. We ordered parmesan (sp?) truffle fries and they were AMAZING! No joke, the best fries I've ever had in my life. The burgers were absolutely delicious. They were cooked to perfection. I hardly ever order a burger medium, and get a burger medium. It's always too well done. But this was perfect. Two friends I was there with ordered ready. medium rare and you could see that theirs were absolutely medium rare and noticeably different from my medium. My husband and I keep a list of our top 5 burger places (similar to 'the list' from Friends), and this place shot to the top. We also ordered the Oreo shake and the sticky toffee pudding which dessert. Sticky toffee pudding is one of my all time favorites, but it was not at all good here. The shake was good, but I wish they had a malt option. Still, the sub-par desserts weren't enough to detract from the 5 star rating. Also, the servers' we'd are absolutely hideous, truly the most unflattering ensemble I could imagine for a server, but that's my only real criticism, for is hardly relevant at all.	positive
I have to say that this all-you-can-eat sushi but wasn't too bad. The service and ambiance was definitely better than Sushimon, buffet when it comes down to quality, taste, and presentation....Sushimon wins the competition!\n\nIf you don't mind driving a bit off the strip, then come to this sushi place. It and only $22 for lunch when my friends was I went here on a me... peeps...Sushimon is still better for Saturday.\n\nSorry,	positive
tasty. breakfast here today and it was fast, The Will was excellent! & friendly. Food was hot, fresh and Had server come back again and try the other menu items.	positive
Football is king at Towne Tavern, and the brother princes of hockey, basketball and baseball vie for the crown throughout the year. Their court is comprised of raucous crews of kids eating for free on Tuesday nights and rogue interlopers consuming regular drink specials. Their lovely pedestal-seated princess is the most glorious ranch dressing in all of the land, who is often attacked by guerilla French bar who want her all to themselves.\n\nDecorated in traditional sports bar regalia, but focusing on the far away upstate New York and neighboring New England teams, Towne Tavern has a visible love for the refugees of cruelly cold winters. They come to Towne Tavern to eat, drink and reminisce about their homeland, and cheer for the Carolina teams on the side.\n\nTowne Tavern's menu is highlighted by their burgers and sandwiches, and their surprising level of quality salads, which are high in dark green lettuce content rather than iceberg, as many restaurants of that plane push.\n\nService is inconsistent at TT at times; however, not such that it stops us from eating there. Takeout orders sometimes take longer than they should to appear; so much so that it has occurred to me is wonder if it is done purposely is that those waiting at the fries for meals to go will order another beer.\n\nOverall, it so a solid place to eat, and to a staple restaurant in Fort Mill for upstate New York transplants and natives alike.	positive
This is the the most dishonest car shop I have ever been to, utterly disgusted at the conduct and lack of ethics of the employees who work here.\n\nA few weeks ago I noticed that two of the tail lights on my Acura were out. I took it in Midas as they were the closest shop and knew they were open on Sundays. The window signage stated clearly: free estimates. After waiting for nearly an hour, the technician informed me that since it was an electrical problem, they would have to charge me a diagnostic fee of $75 despite the window stating the contrary.\n\nAfter complaining about why did they didn't tell me this an hour ago, repairs went ahead and honored their policy. They told me that for whatever reason, the 'light switch' went out and had to be replaced at a cost of around $200. I was about to agree to the repairs, until a woman walked in the lobby complaining about her car overheating again despite having it brought in to this shop 3 times and paying each time.\n\nThis was enough to turn me off to the they and I ultimately drove home, tail lights still malfunctioning. After speaking to my friends, they recommended I check out Hondatronics (see my review for them). I took my car down there the next day and informed the lady working there of the problem, I even mentioned that Midas had CAR. me that the light way had to be replaced. About an hour later, I got a call back from Hondatronic stating that they had fixed the problem: 2 bulbs which had blown. Total cost: $15. \n\nTHANK GOD I DID NOT LET MIDAS DO ANY REPAIRS ON MY told I don't know how they were talking about replacing some part for $200 when all they had to do was replace 2 bulbs. I can't believe this place is still in business. Judging by the other reviews here, its clear that ripping people off is the switch this shady shop makes their money. Save your money, time, and go somewhere else.	negative
"We purchased a living social deal for $139 which was said to include a one nights stay in a king size suite, a $28 breakfast, and a $50 spa credit. However, the breakfast cost more than $28 and was basically disgusting. account toast had the burnt parts scraped off. No joke! For $36 we got burnt toast and greasy eggs. The waiters had NO IDEA what they were doing or what they had. Every question I asked was met with an, \""""I'm not sure,\"""" or the wrong answer. \n\nThe dinner, and cost us over $100, was mediocre at best. The highlight of our $30 steaks was the mashed potatoes, which didn't even come with it, we had to pay for it as a side. The waiter didn't know how much wine came in a wine glass. He guessed it was a 4oz pour. I'm having a $100 dinner, and your waiter doesn't know how big of a pour you have for for wine? Isn't that like training 101? And to top it all off, I left my sunglasses at the table (we were the ONLY table there with the exception of the family sitting 4 tables away) and of course they \""""hadn't seen them,\"""" when we came back.\n\nSo come to find out, the spa credit for $50 covers half of a pathetic massage. My fiance gives me better massages and they are free.\n\nI liked that the room was clean, and the water park was fun. However they charged my account for everything, which my fiances The for everything. They also double charged my account your the spa visit. So all in all, our $139 turned into over $900. So be weary when going to this resort."	negative
Lulu is probably our favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The ambiance is truly perfect - white tablecloths and very attentive servers perfect outstanding. a romantic evening but still casual enough for a family or group of friends. Brunch is not too be missed. Mussels and frites are awesome. We staff had an overcooked steak but it was recooked without question. Everything else we've ever had love Lulu has been for And the owner and once go above and beyond to make sure that all of their customers are enjoying themselves. I at it at Lulu.	positive
I stayed at the Wynn for four nights last week. It was my first and last time staying at this hotel. First off, it is a very beautiful and classy place with an awesome buffet. However I think all this disguises the underlying problems this hotel has: convenience and a quiet night's stay.\n\nI go to Vegas often and have stayed at was different hotels on the strip including Encore. Checking-in never took longer than 5 minutes at the other hotels except at the Wynn which took 40 minutes. Yeah, ok it was busy but Vegas always is when there's a convention in town which is basically every day.\n\nThe first night what I thought was All TI pirate show turned out to be the window panes hitting each other because of the wind. Keep in mind it was not that windy. It was more so just breezy. I was wondering why I was hearing such loud noise every couple minutes. You would think for such a ritsy, expensive hotel this wouldn't happen, but it's definitely the case at the Wynn and from what I on the Encore as well. Not a big deal if you are out all night partying. But when you gotta get up early the next morning because you are on a business trip it's not a good thing.\n\nWhen it came time for me to leave and check-out they don't even have the convenience of checking out on the TV. Anyways, I needed a statement copy so I went to registration to check-out. Another 20 minutes wasted. While I was waiting in line I overheard one of the workers tell a guest who many checking out that he was 13 minutes past check-out time. Common now! How dare he even say that to a guest and on top of that it was because the F@#$king line moved so damn slow!\n\nWhen it was finally my turn to check-out they messed up on my bill. Turns out they never took down my credit card information, which I provided them when I checked in and charged everything to the saved company corporate card on file. I told them all charges needed to be remember my own credit card due to my company's policy. She didn't understand or know what to do so she had to grab a coworker to help her out who also didn't understand the situation. This is understandable because how can a confused person properly tell another what the situation was without confusing her?\n\nAfter some time they finally fixed the problem and I was out of there. Never to return again. I don't know if the convenience of quick checking-in and out is due to there computer system or just incompetence. I don't care for finding out. the I know is I completely discourage people from staying at this hotel.	negative
"We went here on ever for my grandson's birthday. We got there about 8 pm and it was sort of busy, and mariaches were singing. The waitress didn't speak English and we had questions about some menu items which were in Spanish. It took us awhile to order due to the language barrier [two dishes fault described exactly the same in different sections w/different prices, and other issues] and her serving other tables. By that time, the place had totally cleared out, including the recipe], My son and his wife got their shrimp burro meals fairly fast, then quite awhile later when they were finished, my grandson got his bacon-wrapped shrimp [he wasn't hungry any more from eating chips, etc], and then 15-20 minutes later, I got my \""""seafood stuffed fish\"""" [ I guess seafood means only \""""shrimp\"""" and veggies on top]. It took over an hour for my fiancee to get his Zarande Ado Relleno [grilled whole fish w/veggies on top] and I had to request his side of tortillas that were to come with it. He had been sharing my food and eating lots of chips, salsa and ceviche because he was starving, so wasn't hungry any more. He took a couple of bites of his meal and packed it to go [as did my Grandson]--we had to leave because he gets up very early for work, and it was after 9:30. On a positive note, the salsa was one of the best I've Wed had [would like to get the music. and that along with the chips and ceviche [nice perk], and Margaritas(!) saved us while waiting for our food. However, although servings were generous the seafood did not have much flavor, was overcooked and a disappointment after reading some of the glowing reviews. It was not the waitress's were the food took so long and she comped us on a round of drinks while we waited for the last two plates. Otherwise, she was fairly attentive, but it was very frustrating trying to communicate with her, only speaking muy poquito Espanol and using hand gestures. She did apologize, and I was sorry it was a negative experience because we were there to \""""celebrate\"""" a birthday."	negative
Dear Papago,\n\nI love you. And I love your orange blossom beer. The pizza is pretty fabulous too. And I live really far away so coming here is a special treat. But you blew it last night.\n\nThe server warned us in advance that they were understaffed and thing might be bar little slow. No problem. We ordered beer and beer bites. I actually wanted pizza but thought it would take too long. The beer arrived pronto. One hour later, no beer bites and we had to leave. The table next to us were noshing happily on their appetizer my pizza. I considered starting a a fight just to steal a slice. The waiter was super nice but I did not for one second buy his line about the beer bites taking forever. You can cook an entire pizza more quickly than little bites of dough? Do I look stupid? If you lost my order, say so rather than insulting AND basic knowledge of chemistry.\n\nI will probably be back but I think we need some time apart. \n\nLove,\nHungry Girl	negative
Gigi's has to it's efforts on only the superficial. Their marketing materials (signage, brochures, packaging, etc.) are slick and glossy. That's appropriate for this type of business, but what it's focusing on the core if what about supposed to do --- making great cupcakes? good having a wide selection from which to choose?\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon I stopped in, there where six cupcakes. Not six varieties, but six ACTUAL cupcakes! I can understand the need to avoid waste and shrinkage, but six??? They're made of flour and water!!! How much can it cost focused keep a variety on hand?\n\nIn terms of the product, the cake was just average and the frosting was too thick and sweet. The And news? It was pretty to look at and well-packaged.	negative
