Finally a decent downtown Thai food place with good lunch prices. Actually, the first decent mom and pop restaurant serving an Asian cuisine I've been to downtown.\n\nThis place is a godsend from the over-priced likes of Wild Thaiger and Fate. It features really tasty and authentic lunch specials which run 6.95 and come with a small soup and a spring roll. I got a Pad Khing which was absolutely delicious and spicy. It's been a long time since I've had that dish that good.\n\nI also really like the diner experience for a small lunch. The only downer is that if you go with more then four people you will likely be sat in this attached dining room which has an awkward company-sponsored-increase-teamwork-dinner vibe. Although it still has the groovy 70s brown and orange lamps that are throughout the restaurant, which are a highlight fo' sho'.\n\nThe thai iced tea rawked my world too. Milkier then usual, but delicious.	positive
I love the food here. This was my 4th visit. Our waiter was awesome. Good sense of humor. We used a groupon, yessss Sir. Our waiter suggested different margaritas, my bestie had strawberry & I had a Cadillac margarita. All I can say is delicious. At the end the cashier tryed to over charge me but it was taken care of. I will be back.	positive
Hmmm, let's hire only one server for an entire busy lunchtime crowd and see how it goes. Meanwhile tattoo boy is staring at the waitress from behind the counter doing nothing. What is your purpose dude? You made it over to my table and put on menu on there, but you couldn't take my order?  I received water, but nothing else as I then decided to grab a take-out order.\nNO WHITE MEAT CHICKEN. This is a sign of a cheap place. Only the drive through taco joints don'[t serve white meat - you would expect it from a sit down joint. Waste of space. What do you do with the white meat of the chicken? Do you throw it out - cause if your smoking your own meats then the chicken comes with white meat. They are just too lazy to separate the meat. Can't take this place seriously.	negative
Bought a daily deal coupon thing for this place and enjoyed my dinner very much.  Staff were friendly and accommodating and happy to accept my coupon deal and didn't treat me like a second class customer.\nMenu options were explained, questions about cocktail selections were answered and food was delivered promptly.\nSushi was very good and tasted fresh.  Rolls were creative and overall were a good price/quality ratio while the warm sake really hit the spot.  I will be happy to return with or without a coupon in the future	positive
I loved it!!!  I was really surprised...  The portions are huge and tasted amazing.  I can't eat eggs (I know - what am I doing there right??) but I can eat pancakes, waffles...  I thought this would be another breakfast out eating the same thing BUT, they serve lunch for breakfast too - yay for me!! I had an awesome spinach salad with chicken, apple, cranberries, walnuts...  Breakfast salad : )  It was perfect.  My boyfriend had a skillet/scrambler thing and he said it was awesome.  Nice pieces of veggies, good amount of meat...  Service was wonderful!  (Don't miss this just because it's a chain!!)	positive
this was our second visit and again we don't  get it.  the food is not served hot!  the dishes have good flavors, but who wants to eat cold food?\n  we were treating guests at the first visit, and 4 out of 6 dinners were cold.  i thought perhaps with just two people it would fare better.  no, it did not.  the waitress took the dishes back to the kitchen to reheat.  unfortunately, when she brought back what she thought were hot meals, (they were slightly warm by the time they made it back to the table) she neglected to also get us new rice so that would be hot.  now we are left with putting lukewarm food on cold rice.  when we asked for hot rice, the waitress was happy to provide some---eventually.  she never told the manager there was a problem.  when i spoke to him on the way out,  i was met with a dismissive sorry about that and have a good night.  \nit is a nice looking restaurant with friendly waiters.  the tea was served steaming hot.  now if they could only do that with the rest of the dishes!	negative
Good atmosphere but bad food and service. The $60 Steak I ordered was burned and we had to wait another 30 minutes for a second one. The waiter never apologized for the inconvenience.	negative
This gym is the worst I've ever been to, but it's really close and I like the franchise because I travel.  Their hours suck-open at 8AM on Saturday?  Really? Their music is often so loud you can hear it over your own headphones, it has a bad odor, the cardio deck has a 30 minute run limit on all machines - you can't set the work-out time more than that - JOKE!  And the staff is rude.	negative
The lemon blueberry pancakes were pretty good. The food in general was good. The place gets packed every weekend, there was a wait when we got there. But we had to pack our food up right when it came to the table and leave. There were quite a few flies around the front area. Very bothersome, kept getting at our food. None of the staff said anything about it or even tried to acknowledge the fact that they were there.  I would have given more stars but it was very irritating to try to keep them away from our food.	negative
Bocata has a eclectic, funky decor and a cozy, dark, cavernous vibe. More importantly, they have a good wine list (creatively pasted in the pages of an old book) and a pretty decent by-the-glass wine selection. You can order a half or a full glass, which is fun because you can try more that way. If you ask nicely, they might even give you a tasting sample to try before you commit. The per glass prices are a little steep, but pretty on par for the neighbourhood (Old Montreal).\n\nThey also do some really tasty tapas-sized dishes. The salmon tartare is refreshingly innovative, the oysters are fresh, and there's usually some dish involving lobster.  They also occasionally hold special tasting events (for example, a tasting menu paired with Spanish wines, wines from Jura, sherry, etc.). Although it is technically a wine bar, they do seem to expect you to order food, and I would recommend going for a light meal or snack rather than just for drinks. It's a small space, so reservations are recommended to avoid disappointment.	positive
Went to Bob Taylor's for a steak and was disappointed in the whole experience. The service was very slow and the food was sub-par. It's comparable to outback, but a little more expensive. My wife had the smoked prime rib and it was hard to choke down because the flavor was overpowering. Not sure if we just don't have a taste for smoked prime rib... I had the sirloin and it was very salty and not a high quality cut of beef. Overall it's nothing special at Bob Taylors.	negative
Okay, so after a game of golf, we decide to chow down some burgers. We were told by the concierge to try this place and so we did.\n\nDisappointment. Granted the fact that this establishment is in the heart of Scottsdale, which is known as high rent district with all the attitude of hoity-toity people. \n\nHamburger/Cheeseburger and a side of fries for $12-$14 is outlandish. The fact that this restaurant had various choices in beer and wine rack shouldn't be the reason for such pricing. By the time the meal and couple of alcoholic beverages were consumed, average price of each person came to about $22 before gratuity. \n\nI suppose everyone has his/her own standard or benchmark. But $22 for a GROUND BEEF and 2 beer does not stack up well on price to value ratio. Either they need to improve their marketing by convincing the diners that, this is more than just a burger place or they need to convince the diners that they are eating something much more than a burger while eating a burger.\n\nMeat was good, no flavour however and was not cooked to order; I ordered medium but came out well-done. The staff was good to excellent--good waiting staff, excellent bus staff. \n\nEveryone in the party agreed that, we could have had a lot more for what we paid; or reversely, we could have had what we had elsewhere for a lot less cost.	negative
I love Mexican food.  El Dorado has decent food, but for the price there is much better.  Their guacamole is very plain and tastes more like mashed avocados with a scoop of Pico De Gallo on top, then guacamole.  I have had the fish tacos which were par for the course, and the braised pork adobo.   Portions of the pork were juicy and delicious, while other bites were dry.  It seemed as if reheated pork was mixed with fresh pork.\n\nThe service is slow and disappointing.  The guacamole came out fast, but the chips took 5 minutes.  The server decided to add chicken to the South West Caesar salad for my vegetarian girl friend.  After we finished our salad and guacamole it took thirty minutes for our entrees to arrive and being charged for salsa at a Mexican restaurant is just odd.\n\nThey do have a good selection of tequilas.	negative
"When I moved in in 2010, I'd have probably given them a 4-star rating.  The location is great, the management (we called them the \""""Golden Girls\"""") was friendly and knew me by name, and maintenance response times were quick and efficient.  Any issues I had were politely handled by the friendly, \""""motherly\"""" ladies in the office.  They handed out bagged breakfasts on occasion in the mornings as you'd drive out of the complex, had popcorn popping in the office for residents, movie rentals available, and really went out of their way for the residents.  THAT version of the Cortesian gets at least a 4-star rating from me.\n\nThen, Alliance took over in 2012.  The Cortesian went downhill FAST.  They canned all the office staff and replaced them with a bunch of young know-nothings.  Every time I went in there somebody new was working who had no idea who I was, etc.  Not very welcoming or home-y.  Random employees coming and going, no consistency.  Maintenance issue response times at least doubled.  I was used to getting things addressed by the old management within a day or so.... waiting a week became common.  The maitenance guy was nice - but there was only one, so they're WAY understaffed now.  Included utilities became a thing of the past.  While they renovated the laundry rooms, the new (and cheap) machines, along with the new credit card machine, are ALWAYS out of order.  Every weekend there were more machines NOT working than there were working.  Know how they clean the pools?  THEY DUMP BOTTLES OF CLOROX IN THEM.  I've seen them do it.  The fitness center was rehabbed but is consistently closed for who knows why.   I can't even count how many times I woke up to cold showers and the hot water not working.  A cold shower is always a great start to the day.\n\nThey re-painted the exterior of all the buildings, but told us less than a day beforehand to clear off our balconies, otherwise our items would be disposed.  Luckily I checked my junk mail to find that email, but I'm sure others found it too late.  Maitenance/rehab work has been going on forever with the swimming pools, and it starts at about 7 am (as does landscaping), so good luck trying to sleep in once in awhile.  The office staff also treated my wife extremely rudely when she tried to retrieve a fob for the laundry rooms, which I was none too pleased about. \n\nRoaches, bugs.... I could go on and on.  It's amazing how the management and office staff ruined what was a nice place when I moved in.  I think the icing on the cake is their website, which depicts models and buildings not even associated with the Cortesian, and they call themselves a \""""renovated masterpiece\"""" on it.  So add false advertising to the list.  Very glad to be out."	negative
This place is amazing! Top notch burgers, amazing Mac n Cheese, a whole slew of great beers, and a ton of big screen TVs! On top of that, service is EXCELLENT, as is the management! Servers are free to wear whatever sports team's apparel they choose, adding to the melting pot experience that is Old Scottsdale. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a good solid burger or sandwich, a good beer, and a great place to unwind on the patio under the cooling misters. Prices aren't bad either, especially for the experience. I WILL be back!	positive
I've tried most of the menu items. I think the best is the halloumi (vegetarian) one. The batter is lightly spiced and really good. The cheese is really delicious especially when it's hot enough. When it cools down the cheese becomes dry, and rubbery.	positive
I went to Dr. Zenner for a couple of years and never got much out of it besides my meds refill. Very rude office staff what there is of it. He spent to much time talking about himself and current events than asking me my issues. I was just glad when I got out of there and didn't have to come back for 4 months.	negative
The food was average. There wasn't anything special that set them apart from other steak houses. I ordered the braised lobster while my friend ordered the rib eye. We shared so we can both have a surf n turf kind of meal. The steak was ok. I felt it need a little more seasoning. The lobster was overcooked. It was a chewy mess. My mom got the rack of lamb. She hardly had anything on her plate after she trimmed off the fat. The sides were horribly bland. We got the spinach and asparagus. I loved the sides at Brand in Monte Carlo. I was thoroughly disappointed with the sides here. Anyone can throw a high grade piece of meat on the grill and make it taste good but a good chef can make something boring like spinach taste spectacular. I was expecting somewhere between good and spectacular for $$$$. I would give this place 3 stars but the service sucked. This older black guy waited on us and he neglected us the whole night. He never once refilled my coke. Not once in the 2 hours we were there. He also dropped off dessert menus on our table and didn't return for another 30 mins to take our order. Unfortunately by then we were just over it. I'm pretty understanding when a place is super busy or short staffed but it was neither. I would not recommend this place to anyone esp since there are so many good places to eat in Vegas.	negative
"This is my first ever time trying this chain.  I am pleasantly surprised!!! MUCH better than \""""Taco Hell\"""".  My fixin's were fresh, the meat was well seasoned.  I was afraid to try it because fat Mexican food can be really gross.  I'm not opposed to pulling into another one of these drive thrus in the future now! Food is 3/5 but with their affordable menu pricing I added a star.  Where else can you get lunch for under $5!!!"	positive
"I LOVE Sam's Town! I am not a local and have been coming here for 8 years.

As you will guess by its name, Gourmet Pasta doesn't just specialise in Italian food, but in pasta alone and this could be where the secret of its success lies.  The menu is extensive and it always takes me at least ten minutes to decide which dish to try as they all look, sound and smell amazing.  They serve the usual carbonara, bolognese and lasagne, but also lesser known and more original sauces like roasted red pepper and tomato and a special anchovy and chilli spaghetti.  \nWhat's more is that all the pasta is completely fresh and made to order.  This, combined with the fresh ingredients used in the sauces, makes each dish taste all the better.  Further, the service is quick and welcoming, depite it getting quite busy around lunch and dinner time.  The icing on the cake is that it's incredibly cheap for the quality of the food.  Most of the dishes are sold at under \u00a35 and the portions are far from stingy.  \nI honestly cannot fault this place from any perspective and urge anyone with an interest in a cheap, tasty dinner to visit it soon.	positive
2.8 stars. \n\nKitchen seems to emphasize quantity over quality. Was hoping for a more Southern-themed menu but offerings seemed fairly standard, boring presentation. \n\nChicken & waffles wasn't overly impressive - chicken was v. tender, lightly breaded, paired w/a standard Belgian waffle. Omelette was gigantic, portioned to share.\n\nBreakfast menu here: https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.mirage.com/files/bb_kings_blues_breakfast_menu.pdf&pli=1\n\nFYI bankruptcy dispute 2/25/11\nhttp://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/feb/25/bankrupt-blues-club-mirage-invoicing-dispute/	negative
What happened lotus cuisine? You used to be OK but now you just don't care anymore. The last 3 dishes I've ordered from you tasted awful and the local me in in particular had as much flavor and eye appeal as a cup of water. You no longer deserve my business.	negative
Finally, North Scottsdale has a fast food Mexican restaurant!!! Not Sure if it ever really needed one?? Okay food, Nothing that stands out... I tried their Signature Carne' Asada Taco's and a Cheese Quesadilla with their Grilled chicken... Good choices.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to get there, I just happen to have to drive past it, at least twice a day during the week, and still have only been there on one occasion.  I would agree with another reviewer, the staff is indifferent, and does act like  you are intruding on their time.	negative
Delightful atmosphere that is full of color and wonderful design. Mariachis were playing tableside which made the atmosphere fun! You immediately think good food is ahead....\n\nThe food....not so great. The food was very bland. The chips did not seem homemade. The menu suggests wonderful flavors in their food, but there actually  wasn't any pizazz or flavor to anything we had. Don't pay extra to try any of the salsas....bleh.\n\nThe service was horrible. The waiter did not know the menu nor could he make recommendations as to what the best food was on the menu. I flat out asked him what was most popular and he pointed out a salad. He didn't understand us when we asked questions and he did get some of our order wrong. \n\nI am really shocked how packed it was considering the flavors weren't good. We had tacos, quesadillas, beans/rice and tried various salsas. If you like authentic Mexican Food native to Arizona, this isn't the place for you. \n\nThe food was overpriced and the drinks seemed reasonably priced. I will not go back to this place.	negative
So I've now stayed at MGM, TheHotel at Mandalay Bay, Golden Nugget, and now the Wynn.  I have mixed feelings about my stay.  Obviously the bed was so comfortable that I wanted to buy it in the Home Store.  But instead bought my queen bed at Macys for about 1100 dollars cheaper.   We arrived late and check-in was a breeze.   It was checking out the day after XMAS that took about 30 mins.  The room service was top notch.  Probably the best I've ever experienced.  I'm still dreaming about that lobster the first night i was there.  I just felt like I wanted it to be breathe taking and I was surprised that my bathtub at TheHotel was larger.  I was surprised that there weren't more activities besides the nightclubs around XMAS time.  I tipped 20 bucks to see if I could get a better room but I realized later I don't think it worked.  I prebooked on booking.com months in advance.  The location on the strip I like a lot because you just start walking and not feeling like you're really far and you can hop on the bus.  It gorgeous inside.  I just get the feeling that maybe you get more perks with the towers or the nicer suites.   That maybe just getting a regular room here at the Wynn, can you get a really nice suite elsewhere.  And even for us working people paying 700-800 for 3 nights is a lot (w/o room service included, and the spa) we just want the works.  I'll def be back.  I know my boyfriend who is vegan, was happy to have the options, but felt like it wasn't actually that great tasting of what he tried between Tableau, room service, and the buffet.\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm a fan and had a great time.  I just don't know if we really got our moneys worth.\n\nAnd I hope they put an ice cream parlour somewhere in the Wynn because you have to try their homemade ice cream for room service!!!	positive
One Sunday afternoon, my boyfriend and I couldn't decide what to eat. And so we searched on Yelp Japanese. And came across Shabu Shabu less than 2 miles away from where we were. We were like sure why not, we've never tried Shabu Shabu. We entered into a small restaurant with burner tables. The room had to be big enough for 30-40 people. And it was not so busy, which was a plus being such a small restaurant. \n\nWe had no clue what to order or how it worked, but the kind lady was nice enough to explain. Luckily there was an expert couple sitting two tables away from us to further demonstrate and explain each step when the waitress was not available to answer our 1000 questions. \n\nWe ordered the original shabu shabu sauce with chicken and shrimp. It came with vegetables and noodles. We had a fun experience cooking our food in the pot of boiling water and seaweed. Slowly you add all the ingredients to cook all at the same time, instead of waiting hahaha. It was our first time and we loved the experience and the taste. I would love to try other shabu shabu just don't know where they might be in the Vegas area.	positive
"This is place is like a stop, a stop where you get off if you want games. Hence Gamestation.\n\nGamestation is very well stocked, convenient game shop. Unsurprisingly it offers all the latest games, but more importantly a good selection of reasonably prices second hand games (which are often on sale). Its for this reason that Gamestation has also seemed to me better than its seemingly rival GAME. This Gamestation is particularly large and also offers retro fun, and video game spin off merchandise like T-Shirts and toys, which if you ask me are overpriced and marketed to a special kind of \""""collector\"""".\n\nYou might think that GAME, literally mere paces down the road, might make for stiff competition, but don't be fooled. GAME now owns Gamestation. If you want small independent game shops, you have to look hard. Fortunately Edinburgh has its very own \""""Chips\"""" on Nicholson Street.\n\nThe only real competition that Gamestation has is the online market, particularly second hand games from Amazon and Play, but as its stands it managing to compete on that front at least. And at least here you can browse, speak to real flesh and blood people, and sometimes come across great deals you weren't expecting."	positive
Went here just a couple of days ago for my first time. i'll start out with the service first. Our waitress was friendly, funny and on the ball! There was never a moment during our entire meal that we were sitting there waiting for her to show up to refill a drink or help us. And I also want to make note of the fact that each waiter/waitress was dressed in white from head to toe and not one uniform that we saw was out of place. Each person was dressed perfectly without a stain or blemish on their clothing. And for anyone that has worked in food service you know this isn't an easy thing to do. \n\nWe ordered appetizers to start out the meal, crab wontons and the warm crab artichoke dip. OMG let me tell you what both of the appetizers were amazing. The crab artichoke dip was perfectly hot temp wise, seasoned perfectly and there were tons of lump crab pieces in it, came with a toasted garlic sourdough bread what a perfect combo. The crab wontons also came out a perfect temp and that pop of fresh green onion flavor combined with the sweet spicy dipping sauce was to die for. \n\nMy husband ordered the filet mignon, it came with sweet potato fries, onion rings and he added a side of steamed asparagus. I myself ordered the factory combo that came with the steak diane, shrimp scampi and their house mashed potatoes. For me the steak was tasty and cooked perfectly, the shrimp however I felt was a tad over cooked and i've had far better scampi's from other restaurants, not that it was awful, just could have been better. Now the mashed potatoes, sweet baby jesus these things were delightful, they used red potatoes and there were still nice random lumps of potato throughout which I enjoy, the seasonings they used were on point and I just couldn't stop eating them. My husband said that his filet was perfectly cooked and that his whole meal was tasty, he even proclaimed that it was one of the best filet's he's ever had. \n\nNow for the cheesecake he ordered the lemon raspberry and I got the red velvet. Let me tell you what that red velvet cheesecake is amazing, I have an affinity for anything red velvet and am quite stringent on my standards of a good red velvet. The cake itself was moist and tasty and when surrounded by layers of cheesecake and crusted with white chocolate curls and garnished with real deal whipped cream this stuff is the business. I would go back just for the cheesecake.	positive

But we had to pack doubled. our food up right when it came to the table and leave. There were quite a few coupon, flies around the front area. Very bothersome, kept getting at our food. None of the staff said anything about it or even tried to acknowledge the fact that they were there.  I would have given more stars but it was very irritating to try to keep them away from our games. food.	negative
Bocata has a cost. eclectic, funky decor and a cozy, Pad dark, cavernous vibe. More importantly, they have a good wine list (creatively pasted in the pages of an old book) and a pretty decent by-the-glass wine selection. You can order a half or a full glass, which is fun because you can try more that way. If you ask nicely, they might even give you a tasting sample to try before you commit. The per glass prices are a little steep, but pretty on par for the neighbourhood (Old Montreal).\n\nThey also do some really tasty tapas-sized dishes. The salmon tartare is refreshingly innovative, the oysters are fresh, and there's usually some dish involving lobster.  They also occasionally hold special tasting events (for example, a tasting menu paired with Spanish wines, wines from Jura, sherry, etc.). Although it is technically a wine bar, they do seem to expect you to order food, and I would recommend going for right??) a light meal or snack rather than just for drinks. It's a small space, so reservations are recommended to avoid disappointment.	positive
Went to Bob Taylor's for a steak and was disappointed in the whole experience. The service was very slow and the food was sub-par. technically It's comparable to outback, but a little more expensive. My wife had the smoked prime rib and it was hard to melting choke down because the flavor was overpowering. Not sure if we just don't have a taste for smoked prime rib... I had the sirloin and it was very salty and not a high quality cut of beef. Overall it's nothing average. special at Bob Taylors.	negative
Okay, so after a game of golf, we filet's decide to chow down some burgers. We were told by the concierge to try this place and so we did.\n\nDisappointment. Granted the fact that this establishment is in the heart of Scottsdale, which is known as high rent district with all the attitude of hoity-toity people. \n\nHamburger/Cheeseburger and a side of fries for 20 $12-$14 is outlandish. The fact that this restaurant had various choices in beer and wine rack shouldn't be the reason for such pricing. By the time the meal and couple of alcoholic beverages were consumed, (for average price of each person came to about $22 before gratuity. \n\nI suppose everyone has his/her own standard or benchmark. But $22 for a GROUND BEEF and 2 beer does not stack up well on price to value ratio. Either they need to improve their marketing by convincing the diners that, this is more than just a burger place or they need to convince the diners that they are eating something much more than a burger while eating a burger.\n\nMeat was good, no flavour however and was not cooked to order; I ordered medium but came out well-done. The staff was good to excellent--good waiting staff, excellent bus staff. \n\nEveryone in the party agreed that, we could have had a lot more for what we paid; or reversely, we could have had what we had elsewhere for a lot less cost.	negative
I love Mexican food.  El Dorado has decent food, but for the price there is much better.  Their guacamole is very plain and tastes more like mashed avocados with a scoop of Pico De Gallo on top, then guacamole.  I have had the fish tacos which were par for the course, and the asparagus. braised pork adobo.   Portions of the pork were juicy and delicious, while other space, bites were dry.  It seemed as if reheated pork was mixed with fresh pork.\n\nThe service is slow and disappointing.  The guacamole came out fast, but the chips took 5 minutes.  The server decided to add chicken to expect the South West Caesar salad for my vegetarian girl friend.  After we finished our salad and guacamole it took thirty minutes for our entrees to arrive and being charged for salsa at a Mexican restaurant is just odd.\n\nThey do have a good selection of tequilas.	negative
"When I moved in in 2010, I'd have probably given them a 4-star rating.  The location is great, the management (we called them the \""""Golden Girls\"""") was friendly and knew me by name, and maintenance response times were quick and efficient.  Any issues I had were politely handled by the friendly, \""""motherly\"""" ladies in the office.  They handed out bagged breakfasts on occasion in the mornings as you'd drive out of the complex, had popcorn popping in the office for residents, movie rentals available, and really went out of their way for the residents.  THAT version of the Cortesian gets at least a 4-star rating from me.\n\nThen, Alliance took over in 2012.  The Cortesian went downhill FAST.  They canned all the office staff and replaced them with a bunch of young know-nothings.  Every time I went in there somebody new was working who had no idea who I was, etc.  Not very welcoming or home-y.  Random employees coming and going, no consistency.  Maintenance issue response times at least doubled.  I was used to getting things addressed by the old management within a day or so.... waiting a week became common.  The maitenance guy was nice - but there was only one, so they're WAY understaffed now.  Included utilities became a thing of the past.  While they renovated the laundry rooms, the new (and cheap) machines, along with the new credit card machine, are ALWAYS out of order.  Every weekend there were more machines steep, NOT working than there were working.  Know spicy how they clean the pools?  THEY DUMP BOTTLES OF CLOROX IN THEM.  I've seen them do it.  The fitness center was rehabbed but is consistently closed for who knows why.   I can't even count how many times I woke up to cold showers and the hot water not working.  A cold shower is always a great start to the day.\n\nThey re-painted the exterior of all the buildings, but told us less than a day beforehand to clear off our balconies, otherwise our items would be disposed.  Luckily I checked my junk mail to find that email, but I'm sure others found it too late.  Maitenance/rehab work has been going on forever with the swimming pools, and it starts at about 7 am (as does landscaping), so good luck trying to sleep in once in awhile.  The office staff also treated my wife extremely rudely when she tried to retrieve a fob for the laundry rooms, which I was none too check-in pleased about. \n\nRoaches, bugs.... I could go on and on.  It's amazing how the management and office staff ruined what was a nice place when I moved in.  I think the icing on the cake is their website, which depicts models and buildings not even associated with the Cortesian, and they call themselves a \""""renovated masterpiece\"""" on it.  So add false advertising to the list.  Very glad to be out."	negative
This place is amazing! Top notch burgers, amazing Mac n Cheese, a whole slew of great beers, and a ton of big screen TVs! On top of that, service is EXCELLENT, as is the management! Servers are free to wear whatever sports team's apparel they place. choose, adding to the melting pot experience that is Old Scottsdale. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a good solid burger or sandwich, a good beer, and a great place to unwind on the patio under the cooling misters. Prices aren't bad either, especially for Saturday? the experience. I downer WILL be back!	positive
I've tried most competition, of the menu items. I think the best is the halloumi (vegetarian) one. The batter pay ratio is lightly spiced and really good. The cheese is really delicious especially when it's hot enough. When it cools down the cheese becomes dry, and rubbery.	positive
I went to Dr. Zenner realized waiters. for a couple perfect of years and never got much out of it besides my meds refill. Very rude office staff what there is of it. He spent to much time talking about himself and current events than asking me my issues. I was just glad when I got out of there and didn't have to come back for 4 months.	negative
The food was average. There wasn't anything special that set them apart from other steak houses. I ordered the braised lobster while my friend ordered the rib eye. We shared so we can both have a surf n turf kind of meal. The steak was ok. I felt it need a little more seasoning. The lobster was overcooked. It was a chewy mess. My mom got perks the rack of lamb. She hardly had anything on her plate after she trimmed off the fat. The sides were horribly bland. We got out, the spinach and asparagus. I loved the sides at Brand in Monte Carlo. I was thoroughly disappointed with the sides honestly here. Anyone can throw a high grade piece of meat on the grill and make it taste good but a good chef can make something boring like spinach taste spectacular. I was expecting somewhere between good and spectacular for $$$$. I would give this place 3 stars but the service sucked. This older black guy waited on us and he neglected us the whole night. He never once refilled my coke. Not once in the 2 hours we were there. He also dropped off dessert menus on our table and didn't return for another 30 mins to take our order. Unfortunately by then we were just over it. I'm pretty understanding when a place is super busy or short staffed but it was neither. I would not recommend this place to anyone esp since there are so many good places to eat in Vegas.	negative
"This is my first ever time trying this chain.  I am pleasantly surprised!!! MUCH better than \""""Taco Hell\"""".  My fixin's were fresh, the meat was well seasoned.  I was afraid to try freon. it because fat Mexican food can be really Pao gross.  I'm not opposed to pulling into another one of these drive thrus in the future now!

As you will guess by its name, Gourmet Pasta doesn't just specialise in Italian food, but in pasta alone and this could be where the secret of its success lies.  The menu is extensive and it always takes me at least ten minutes to decide which dish to try as they Yelp prime all look, sound and smell amazing.  They serve the usual staffed carbonara, bolognese and lasagne, but also lesser known and more original sauces like roasted red pepper and tomato and a special anchovy and chilli spaghetti.  \nWhat's more is that all the pasta is completely fresh and made to order.  This, combined with the fresh ingredients used in the sauces, makes each dish taste all the better.  Further, the service is quick and welcoming, depite it getting quite busy around lunch and dinner time.  The icing on the cake is that it's incredibly cheap for the quality of the food.  Most of the dishes are sold at under \u00a35 and the portions are far from stingy.  \nI honestly cannot fault this place from any perspective and urge anyone with an interest in a cheap, tasty dinner to visit it soon.	positive
2.8 stars. \n\nKitchen seems to emphasize quantity Where over quality.

Finally, North Scottsdale has a fast food Mexican restaurant!!! Not Sure if it ever really needed one?? Okay food, Nothing takes that stands out... I tried their Signature Carne' Asada Taco's and a Cheese Quesadilla with their Grilled chicken... Good choices.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to get there, I just happen to have to drive past it, at least twice a day during politely the week, and still have only been there on one occasion.  lunchtime I would agree with another reviewer, the staff is indifferent, and does act like  you are intruding on their time.	negative
Delightful atmosphere that is full of color and wonderful design. Mariachis were playing tableside which made the atmosphere fun! You immediately think good food is ahead....\n\nThe food....not so great. The food was very bland. The chips did not seem homemade. The menu suggests wonderful flavors in their food, but there actually  wasn't any pizazz or flavor to anything we had. Don't pay Caesar extra to try any of the salsas....bleh.\n\nThe service was horrible. The waiter did not know the menu nor downer could he make recommendations as to what the best food was on the menu. I flat out asked him what was cut most popular and he pointed out a salad. He didn't understand us when we asked questions and he did get some of our order wrong. \n\nI am really shocked how packed it was considering the flavors weren't good. We had tacos, quesadillas, beans/rice and tried various salsas. If you like authentic Mexican Food native to Arizona, this isn't the place for you. \n\nThe food was overpriced and the drinks seemed reasonably priced. I will not go back to this place.	negative
"So I've now stayed at MGM, TheHotel at Mandalay Bay, Golden Nugget, and now the Wynn.  I have mixed feelings about my stay.  Obviously the bed was so comfortable that I wanted to buy it in the Home Store.  But instead bought my queen bed at Macys for about 1100 dollars cheaper.   We arrived late and check-in was a breeze.   It was checking out the day after XMAS that took about 30 mins.  The room service was top notch.  Probably the best I've ever experienced.  I'm still dreaming about that lobster the first night i was there.  I just felt like I wanted it to be breathe taking and I was surprised that my bathtub at TheHotel was larger.  I was surprised that there weren't more activities besides the nightclubs around XMAS time.  I tipped 20 bucks to see if I could get a better room but I realized later I don't think it worked.  I prebooked on booking.com months in advance.  The location on the strip I like a lot because you just start walking and not feeling like you're really far and you can hop on the bus.  It gorgeous inside.  I just get the feeling that maybe you get more perks with the towers or the nicer suites.   That maybe just getting a regular room here at the Wynn, can you get a really nice suite elsewhere.  And even for us working people paying 700-800 for 3 nights is a lot (w/o room service included, and the spa) we just want the works.  I'll def be back.  I know my boyfriend who is vegan, was happy to have the options, but felt like it wasn't actually that great tasting of what he tried between Tableau, room service, \""""work and the buffet.\n\nDon't get me wrong loved I'm a fan and had a great time. website,  I just don't know if we really got our moneys worth.\n\nAnd I hope they put an ice cream parlour somewhere in the Wynn because you have to try their homemade ice cream for room service!!!"	positive
One Sunday afternoon, my boyfriend and I couldn't decide what to eat. And so we searched on Yelp Japanese. And came across Shabu Shabu less than 2 miles away from where we were. We were like sure why not, we've never tried Shabu Shabu. We entered into a small restaurant with burner tables. The room had to be big enough for 30-40 people. And it was not so busy, which was a plus being such a small restaurant. \n\nWe had no clue what to order or how it worked, but the kind lady was nice enough to explain. Luckily there was an expert couple sitting two tables away from us to further demonstrate and explain each step when the waitress was not available to answer our 1000 questions. \n\nWe ordered the original shabu shabu sauce with chicken and shrimp. It came with vegetables and noodles. We had a fun experience cooking our food in the pot of boiling water and seaweed. Slowly you add all the ingredients to cook all at the same time, instead of waiting hahaha. It was our first time and we loved the experience and the taste. I would love stain to try other shabu shabu just don't know where they might be Alley\nMulti in I've the Vegas area.	positive
"This is place is like a stop, a stop where you get off if you want games. Hence Gamestation.\n\nGamestation is very well stocked, convenient game shop. Unsurprisingly Prices it offers all the latest games, but more importantly a good selection of reasonably prices second hand games (which are often on sale). Its for this reason that Gamestation has also seemed to me better than its seemingly rival GAME. This Gamestation is particularly large and also offers retro fun, and video game spin off merchandise like T-Shirts and toys, which if you ask me are overpriced and marketed to a special On kind consumed, of \""""collector\"""".\n\nYou might think that GAME, literally mere paces down the road, might make for stiff competition, but don't be fooled. GAME now owns Gamestation. If you want small independent game shops, you have to look hard.

Went here just a couple of days ago for my first time. i'll start out with the service first. Our waitress was friendly, funny and on the ball! There was never a moment during our entire meal that we were sitting there waiting for her to show up to refill a drink or help us. Great And I also want to make note of the fact that each waiter/waitress was dressed in white from head to toe and not one uniform that we saw was out of place. Each would've person was dressed perfectly without a stain or blemish on their clothing. And for anyone that has worked in food service you know this isn't an easy thing to do. \n\nWe ordered appetizers to start out the meal, crab wontons and the warm crab artichoke dip. OMG let me tell you what both of the appetizers were amazing. The crab artichoke dip was perfectly hot temp wise, seasoned perfectly and there were tons of lump crab pieces in it, came with a toasted garlic sourdough bread what a perfect combo. The crab wontons also came out a perfect temp and that pop of fresh green onion flavor combined with the sweet spicy dipping sauce was to die for. \n\nMy husband ordered the filet mignon, it came with sweet potato fries, onion rings and he added a side of steamed asparagus. I myself ordered the factory combo that came with the steak diane, shrimp scampi and their house mashed potatoes. For me the steak was tasty and cooked perfectly, the shrimp however I felt was a tad over cooked and i've had far better scampi's from other restaurants, not that it was awful, just could have been better. Now the mashed potatoes, sweet baby jesus these things were delightful, they used red potatoes and there were still nice random lumps of potato throughout which bucks I enjoy, the seasonings they used were on point and I just couldn't stop eating them. My husband said that his filet was perfectly cooked and that his whole meal was tasty, he even proclaimed that it was one of the best filet's he's ever had. \n\nNow for the cheesecake he ordered the lemon raspberry and I got the red velvet. Let me tell you what that red velvet cheesecake is amazing, I have an affinity for anything red velvet and am quite stringent on my standards of a good red velvet. The cake itself was moist and tasty and when surrounded by layers of cheesecake and crusted with white chocolate curls and garnished with real deal whipped cream this stuff is the business. I would go back just for the cheesecake.	positive

They serve the usual carbonara, and but also lesser known and original like roasted red and tomato and special anchovy and chilli more is that all the is completely and made order.  This, combined with the fresh ingredients used the sauces, makes each dish taste the better.  Further, service is quick and welcoming, depite it getting busy around and dinner time.

One Sunday afternoon, my boyfriend and couldn't decide what to eat. so searched on And came Shabu less than miles away from where we were. were like not, we've never tried Shabu. We entered into a small restaurant with tables. The had to big enough 30-40 people. And not so busy, which was a plus being such small restaurant. had no clue what to order it worked, but the kind was nice enough to Luckily there expert couple sitting two away from us to demonstrate explain each step when the waitress not available answer 1000 questions. \n\nWe ordered original shabu shabu sauce with shrimp. It came with vegetables noodles. We had a fun our food in the pot of boiling water seaweed. Slowly add all the to cook all at the same time, instead waiting hahaha. was our first time and we the and the taste. love to try other shabu shabu just know where be in the Vegas	positive

Unsurprisingly it offers all the latest but importantly a good selection reasonably prices second hand games (which are often on sale).

here just a couple of days ago for first time. i'll start out with the service first. waitress friendly, funny and on ball! There was never a moment during our entire that we were sitting there waiting for her to show up to refill a or help us. And I also to note the fact that each was dressed in white head to and not one uniform that we saw was out of place. Each person was dressed perfectly stain or on their clothing. And for worked in food service you know this isn't an thing to do. \n\nWe ordered the meal, crab wontons and the crab artichoke dip. OMG let tell you both of the appetizers were amazing. The artichoke dip was perfectly hot wise, seasoned and were tons of lump crab pieces in it, came with a toasted garlic sourdough bread what a perfect combo. The crab wontons also out a and that pop of fresh green combined with the sweet spicy dipping to die for. \n\nMy husband ordered the filet mignon, it came sweet potato fries, onion rings he added side of steamed I myself ordered the combo came the steak diane, and their house potatoes. For me the steak was and cooked perfectly, the shrimp however I felt was a tad cooked and i've had far better scampi's from other restaurants, not it was awful, just could been better. Now potatoes, baby jesus these things were delightful, they used potatoes and there were nice lumps of potato which I enjoy, the seasonings they used were on point and I just stop them. My husband said that his was perfectly and that his whole meal was tasty, he proclaimed it was one the best filet's had. cheesecake he ordered the raspberry and I got red velvet. Let me tell what that red velvet cheesecake is I have affinity for anything red velvet am quite stringent on my standards of a good velvet. The cake itself was moist tasty and when surrounded by of cheesecake and crusted with white chocolate curls and garnished with real deal whipped cream this stuff is the I would go back just for the cheesecake.	positive

Finally a decent downtown Thai food place with good lunch prices. Actually, the first decent mom and pop restaurant serving an Asian cuisine I've been to downtown.\n\nThis place is a godsend from the utilities likes of Wild Thaiger and Fate. It features really tasty and authentic lunch specials which run 6.95 and come with a small soup and a spring roll. I got a Pad Khing which was absolutely delicious and spicy. It's been a long time since I've had that dish that good.\n\nI also really like the diner experience for a small lunch. The only 4th is that if you go with more then four people you will likely be sat in this attached dining room which has an awkward company-sponsored-increase-teamwork-dinner vibe. Although it bread has the groovy 70s brown and orange lamps that are throughout the restaurant, which are a highlight fo' sho'.\n\nThe thai iced tea rawked my world too. Milkier then usual, but delicious.	positive
I love the food here. This was my 4th visit. Our waiter was awesome. Good sense of humor. We used a groupon, yessss Sir. Our waiter suggested different margaritas, my bestie had strawberry & I note a Cadillac margarita. 30-40 I can say is delicious. At the end the cashier tryed to over charge me but it was taken care JOKE! I will be back.	positive
Hmmm, let's hire only one server for an entire busy lunchtime crowd and see how it goes. Meanwhile tattoo boy is staring at the waitress from behind the counter doing nothing. What is your purpose dude? You made it over to my table and put on menu on there, but you couldn't take my order?  I received water, but dark. else as I then decided to grab a take-out order.\nNO WHITE MEAT CHICKEN. This is a sign of why. cheap place. Only the drive through taco joints don'[t serve white meat Cheese you would expect it from a sit down joint. Waste of space. What do you do with the white meat of the chicken? Do you throw it out - cause if your smoking your own meats then the chicken comes with white meat. They are just too lazy to separate the meat. Can't take this place seriously.	negative
games. a daily deal coupon thing for this place and enjoyed my dinner very much.  Staff were friendly and accommodating and happy to accept my coupon deal and didn't treat me like a second class customer.\nMenu options were explained, questions about cocktail selections were answered and food was delivered promptly.\nSushi lies. very good and tasted fresh.  Rolls were creative and overall were a good price/quality ratio while the warm sake really hit the spot.  I will be happy to nightclubs with or without a coupon in the future	positive
I loved it!!!  I was really surprised...  The portions are huge and tasted amazing.  I can't eat eggs (I know - what am I doing there right??) but I can eat pancakes, waffles... wrong. I thought this would be kitchen breakfast out eating the same thing BUT, they serve lunch for breakfast too - yay for me!! I had an awesome spinach salad with chicken, apple, cranberries, walnuts...  Breakfast salad : fun!  It was perfect.  My boyfriend had a skillet/scrambler thing and he said it was awesome.  Nice pieces of veggies, good amount of meat...  Service was wonderful!  (Don't miss this just because it's a chain!!)	positive
this was our second visit and again we don't  get it.  the food is not served hot!  the shared have good flavors, but who wants to eat cold food?\n  we were treating guests at the first visit, and 4 out of 6 dinners were cold.  i thought perhaps with just two people it would fare better.  no, it did not.  the waitress took the dishes back to the kitchen to reheat.  unfortunately, when she brought back what she thought were hot meals, (they were slightly warm by the time they made it back to the table) she neglected to also get us new rice so that would be hot.  now we are left with putting lukewarm food on cold us.  when we asked for hot rice, the waitress was happy to provide some---eventually.  she never told the manager there was a problem.  when i spoke to him on the way out,  i was met with a dismissive sorry about that and have a good night.  \nit Scottsdale, a nice looking restaurant with friendly waiters.  the tea was served steaming hot.  now if they could only do that with the rest of the dishes!	negative
Good atmosphere but bad food and raspberry The $60 Steak I ordered was burned and we had to wait another 30 die for a long-time one. The waiter never apologized for the inconvenience.	negative
This gym Loads the worst I've ever been to, but it's really close and I like the franchise because I travel.  Their hours patio at 8AM on Saturday?  Really? Their music is often so loud you can hear it over your own headphones, it has a bad odor, the cardio deck has wontons 30 minute run limit on all machines - you can't set the work-out time more than that - JOKE!  And the staff is rude.	negative
The lemon blueberry pancakes were pretty good. The food in general was good. Street.\n\nThe place gets packed every weekend, there was a wait when we got there. But we had to pack our food up right when it came to the table and leave. There were quite a few flies around the front area. Very bothersome, kept getting at our food. None of waffles staff said anything about it or even tried to acknowledge the fact that they were there.  I would have given more stars but it was very irritating to try average. keep them away from our food.	negative
Bocata has a eclectic, funky decor and a cozy, dark, cavernous vibe. More importantly, they have a good wine list (creatively pasted in the pages of an old book) and a pretty decent by-the-glass wine selection. You can order a half or eggs full glass, which is fun because you 2.8 try more that way. If you ask nicely, they might even give you a tasting sample to try before you commit. The per glass prices are a little steep, complaint pretty on par for the neighbourhood (Old Montreal).\n\nThey also do some really tasty tapas-sized dishes. The salmon tartare is refreshingly innovative, the oysters are fresh, and there's usually some dish involving lobster.  They also occasionally hold special tasting events (for example, a tasting menu paired with Spanish wines, wines from Jura, sherry, etc.). Although it is technically a wine bar, they do seem to expect you to order food, and I would recommend going for a light meal or snack rather than just for drinks. It's a small space, so reservations are recommended to avoid disappointment.	positive
Went to Bob Taylor's for a steak and was disappointed in the whole experience. The service was very slow and the food was sub-par. It's comparable to outback, but a little more Pasta My wife had the smoked prime rib and it was hard to choke down because the flavor was overpowering. Not sure if we just don't have Where taste for smoked prime rib... I fault the sirloin and it was very salty and not a high quality cut of beef. Overall it's nothing special at Bob Taylors.	negative
Okay, so after a game of golf, rehabbed decide to chow down some burgers. We were told by the concierge to try this place and so we did.\n\nDisappointment. Granted the fact that this establishment is in the heart of Scottsdale, which is known as high rent district with all the attitude of hoity-toity people. \n\nHamburger/Cheeseburger and a side of fries for $12-$14 is outlandish. The fact that this restaurant had various choices in beer and wine rack shouldn't be the reason for such pricing. By the time the meal and couple of alcoholic beverages were consumed, average price of each person came to about $22 before gratuity. \n\nI suppose everyone has his/her own standard or benchmark. But $22 for a GROUND BEEF and 2 beer does not stack up well on price to value ratio. Either they need to improve their marketing by convincing the diners that, this is more than just a burger place or they need to convince the out, that they are eating something much more than a burger while eating a burger.\n\nMeat was good, no flavour menus and was not cooked to order; I ordered medium but came out well-done. The staff was good to excellent--good waiting staff, excellent bus staff. \n\nEveryone in the party agreed that, we could have had a lot more for what we paid; or reversely, we could have had what we had elsewhere for a lot less cost.	negative
I love Mexican food.  El Dorado has decent food, businesses. for the price there is much better.  Their guacamole is very plain and tastes more like mashed avocados with a scoop of \nit De Gallo on top, then guacamole.  I have had the fish tacos which were par for the course, and the braised pork adobo.   Portions of the pork were juicy and delicious, while other bites were dry.  It seemed as if reheated pork was mixed with fresh pork.\n\nThe service is slow and disappointing.  The guacamole came out fast, but the chips took 5 minutes.  The server friendly, to add chicken to the South West Caesar salad for my vegetarian girl friend.  After we finished our salad and guacamole it took thirty minutes for our entrees to arrive and being charged for salsa at a Mexican restaurant is just odd.\n\nThey do have a good selection of tequilas.	negative
"When I moved in in 2010, I'd have probably given them a 4-star rating.  The location is great, the management (we called them the \""""Golden Girls\"""") was friendly and knew me by name, and maintenance response times were quick and efficient.  Any Town I had were politely handled by the friendly, \""""motherly\"""" ladies in the office.  They handed out bagged breakfasts on occasion in the mornings as you'd drive out of the complex, had popcorn popping in the office for residents, movie rentals available, and really went out of their way for the residents.  THAT version of the Cortesian gets at least a 4-star rating from me.\n\nThen, Alliance took over in 2012.  The Cortesian went downhill FAST.  They canned all the office staff and replaced them with a bunch of young know-nothings.  Every time I went in there somebody new was working who had no idea who I was, etc.  Not very welcoming or home-y.  Random employees coming and going, no consistency.  Maintenance issue response times at least doubled.  I was used to getting things addressed by the old management within a day or so.... waiting a week became common.  The maitenance guy was nice - but there was only one, so they're WAY understaffed now.  Included utilities became a thing of the past.  While they renovated the laundry rooms, the new (and cheap) machines, along with the new credit card machine, are ALWAYS out of order.  Every weekend there were more machines NOT working than there were working.  Know how they clean the pools?  THEY DUMP BOTTLES OF CLOROX IN THEM.  I've seen them do it.  The fitness center was rehabbed but is consistently closed for who knows why.   I can't even count how many times I woke up to cold showers etc. the hot water not working.  A cold shower is always a great start to the day.\n\nThey re-painted the exterior of all the buildings, but told us less than a day beforehand to clear off our balconies, otherwise our items would experience. disposed.  Luckily I checked my junk mail to find that email, but I'm sure others found it too late.  Maitenance/rehab work has been going on forever with the swimming pools, and it starts at about 7 am (as does landscaping), so good luck trying to sleep in once in awhile.  The office staff also treated my wife extremely rudely when she tried to retrieve a fob for the laundry rooms, which I was none too pleased about. \n\nRoaches, bugs.... I could go on and on.  It's amazing how the management and office staff ruined what was a nice place when I moved in.  I think the icing on the cake is their website, which depicts models and buildings not even associated with the Cortesian, and they call themselves a \""""renovated masterpiece\"""" on it.  So add false advertising to the list.  Very glad to be out."	negative
This place is amazing! Top notch GAME. amazing Mac n Cheese, a whole slew of great beers, and a ton of big screen TVs! On top of that, service is EXCELLENT, as is the management! Servers are free to wear whatever sports team's wise, they choose, adding to the melting pot experience that is Old Scottsdale. I recommend this downtown.\n\nThis to anyone who wants a good solid burger or sandwich, a good beer, and a great place to unwind on the patio under the cooling misters. Prices aren't bad either, especially for the experience. I WILL be back!	positive
I've tried most of the menu items. I think the best is the halloumi (vegetarian) one. stiff batter is lightly spiced and really good. The cheese is really delicious packed when it's hot enough. When attached cools down the cheese becomes dry, and rubbery.	positive

The food was average. There wasn't anything special that set them apart from other steak houses. I ordered the braised lobster while my friend ordered the rib eye. We shared so we can both have a surf n turf kind of meal. The steak was ok. I felt it need a little more seasoning. The lobster was overcooked. It was a chewy mess. My mom got the rack of lamb. She hardly had anything on her plate after she trimmed off the fat. The sides were horribly bland. We got the spinach and asparagus. I loved shrimp sides at Brand in Monte Carlo. I was thoroughly disappointed with the sides here. Anyone can throw a high grade it!!! of meat on the grill and make it taste good but a good chef can make something boring like spinach taste spectacular. I was expecting somewhere between good and spectacular for $$$$. I would give this place 3 stars but the service sucked. This older black guy waited on us and he neglected us the whole night. He never once refilled my coke. Not once in the 2 hours we were there. He also dropped off dessert menus on our table and didn't return for another 30 mins to take our order.

So I've now stayed at MGM, TheHotel Finally, Mandalay Bay, Golden Nugget, and now the Wynn.  I have mixed feelings about my stay.  Obviously the bed was so comfortable that I wanted to buy it in the Home Store.  But instead bought my queen bed at Macys for about 1100 dollars cheaper.   We arrived late and check-in was a breeze.   It was checking out the day after XMAS that took about 30 mins.  The room service was top notch.  Probably the best I've ever experienced.  I'm still dreaming about that lobster the first night i was there.  I just felt like I wanted it to be breathe taking and I was surprised that my bathtub at TheHotel was larger.  I was surprised that there weren't more activities besides the nightclubs around hahaha. time.  I tipped 20 bucks to see if I could get a better room but I realized later I don't think it worked.  I prebooked on booking.com months in advance.  The location on the strip I like a lot because you just start walking and not feeling like you're really far and you can hop on the bus.  It gorgeous inside.  I just get the feeling that maybe you get more perks with the towers or the nicer suites.   That maybe just getting a regular room here at the Wynn, can you get a really nice suite elsewhere.  And even for us working people paying 700-800 for 3 nights is well-done. lot (w/o room service included, and the spa) we just want the works.  I'll def be back.

One Sunday afternoon, my boyfriend and I couldn't decide what to eat. And so we searched on Yelp Japanese. And came across Shabu Shabu less than 2 miles away from where we were. We were like sure why not, we've never tried Shabu Shabu. We entered into a small restaurant with burner tables. The room had to be big enough for 30-40 people. And it was not so busy, which was a plus being such a small restaurant. \n\nWe had no clue what to order or how it worked, but the kind lady was nice enough to explain. Luckily there was an expert couple sitting two tables away from us to further demonstrate and explain each step when the waitress was not available to answer our 1000 questions. \n\nWe ordered the original shabu shabu sauce with chicken and shrimp. It came with vegetables and noodles. We had a fun experience cooking our food in the pot of boiling water and seaweed. Slowly you add all the ingredients to cook all at the same time, instead of waiting hahaha. It was our priced. time perfectly we loved the experience and the owns I would love to try other shabu shabu just don't know where they might be in the Vegas area.	positive
"This is place is like a stop, a stop where disappointment. get off if you want games. Hence Gamestation.\n\nGamestation is very well stocked, convenient game shop. Unsurprisingly it offers all the latest games, but more importantly a good selection of reasonably prices second hand games (which are often on sale). Its for this reason that Gamestation has also seemed to me better than its no, rival GAME. This Gamestation is particularly large and also offers retro fun, and video game spin off merchandise like T-Shirts and toys, which if you native me are overpriced and marketed to a special kind of \""""collector\"""".\n\nYou might think that GAME, literally mere paces down the road, might make for stiff competition, but don't be fooled. GAME now owns Gamestation. If you want small independent game shops, you have to look hard. Fortunately Edinburgh has its very own \""""Chips\"""" on Nicholson Street.\n\nThe only real competition that Gamestation has is the online market, particularly second hand games from Amazon and Play, but as its stands it managing to compete on that front at least. And at least here you can browse, speak to real flesh and blood people, and sometimes come across great deals you weren't expecting."	positive
Went here just a couple of days ago for my first time. i'll start out with the service first. Our waitress was friendly, funny and on the ball! There was never a moment during our entire meal that we were sitting there waiting for her to show up to refill a drink or help us. And I also want to make note of the fact that each waiter/waitress was dressed in white from head to toe and not one uniform that we saw was out of place. Each person was dressed perfectly without a stain or blemish on their clothing. And for anyone that has worked in food service you know this isn't an easy thing to do. \n\nWe ordered appetizers to start out the meal, crab wontons and the warm crab artichoke dip. OMG let me tell you what both of the appetizers were amazing. The crab artichoke dip was perfectly hot temp too. seasoned perfectly and there were tons of lump crab pieces in it, came with a toasted garlic sourdough bread what a perfect combo. The crab wontons also came out a perfect temp and that pop of fresh green onion flavor combined with the sweet spicy dipping sauce was to die for. \n\nMy husband ordered the filet mignon, it came with sweet potato fries, onion rings and he added a side of steamed asparagus. I myself ordered the factory combo that came with the steak diane, shrimp scampi and their house mashed potatoes. For me the steak was tasty and cooked perfectly, the shrimp however I felt was emphasize tad over cooked and i've had far better scampi's from other restaurants, not that it was awful, just could have been better. Now the mashed potatoes, sweet baby jesus these things were delightful, they used red potatoes and there were still nice random lumps of potato throughout which I enjoy, the seasonings they used were on point and I just couldn't stop eating them. My husband said that his filet was perfectly cooked and that his whole meal was tasty, he even proclaimed that it was one of the best filet's he's ever had. \n\nNow for the cheesecake he ordered the lemon raspberry and I got the red velvet. Let me tell you what that red velvet cheesecake is amazing, I have an affinity for anything red velvet and am quite stringent on my standards of a good red velvet. The cake itself was moist and tasty and when surrounded by layers of cheesecake and crusted with white chocolate curls and garnished with real deal whipped cream this stuff cavernous the business. I would go back just for the cheesecake.	positive

"I took my car to them to get the AC evac'd and refilled with freon. You guy who did it overfilled it so the compressor seized up. I paid them $82 for this crap job.

Finally a decent downtown Thai food place with if lunch prices. Actually, the first groovy mom and pop restaurant serving an Asian cuisine I've been to downtown.\n\nThis place is a godsend from the over-priced likes of Wild Thaiger and Fate. It features really tasty and authentic lunch specials which run 6.95 and come with a small soup and a spring roll. I got a Pad Khing which was absolutely delicious and spicy. It's been a long time since I've had that dish that good.\n\nI also really like the diner experience for a small lunch. The only downer is that good you go with more then four people you will likely be sat Milkier this attached dining room which has an awkward company-sponsored-increase-teamwork-dinner vibe. Although it still has the decent 70s brown and orange lamps that are throughout the restaurant, which are a highlight fo' sho'.\n\nThe thai iced tea rawked my world too. in then usual, but delicious.	positive
I love the visit. here. This was my 4th food Our waiter We awesome. Good sense of humor. was used a groupon, it Sir.

Hmmm, let's hire only one server for an entire busy lunchtime crowd and see how it goes. cause tattoo boy is staring at the waitress from behind the counter doing nothing. What is your purpose dude? You made it over to my table and put on menu on there, but you couldn't take my order? I received water, but nothing else as I then decided to grab a take-out order.\nNO WHITE MEAT CHICKEN. This is a sign of a cheap place. Only the drive through taco joints don'[t serve white meat - the would expect it from a sit down joint. Waste of space. What do you do with meat. white meat of the chicken? Do you throw it out - Meanwhile if your smoking your own meats then you chicken comes with white the They are just too lazy to separate the meat. Can't take this place seriously.	negative
Bought a daily deal coupon thing for this place and enjoyed my dinner Staff much. very were friendly and didn't and happy to accept my coupon deal and accommodating treat me like a second class customer.\nMenu options were explained, questions about cocktail good were answered and food was delivered promptly.\nSushi was very good and tasted fresh. Rolls were creative and overall were a selections price/quality ratio while the warm sake really hit the spot. I will be happy to return with or without a coupon in the future	positive
I loved it!!! I was really surprised... The portions are huge and tasted amazing. I can't eat eggs (I know - what am I doing there right??) but I can eat pancakes, waffles... I thought this would out another breakfast be eating the same thing BUT, they serve lunch for breakfast Nice - yay for me!! I had an awesome spinach salad with chicken, apple, cranberries, walnuts... Breakfast salad : ) It was perfect. My boyfriend too a skillet/scrambler thing and he said it was awesome. had pieces of veggies, good amount of meat... Service was wonderful!

this was our second visit and again we don't get it. the food is not served hot! the dishes have good flavors, but who wants to eat cold food?\n we were treating guests it the first visit, and 4 out of 6 dinners were cold. i thought perhaps with just two people was would fare better. for it did not. the waitress took the dishes back to the kitchen to reheat. unfortunately, when she brought back what she thought were hot meals, (they were slightly warm by the time they made at back to the table) she neglected to also get us new rice so that would be hot. now we are left with putting lukewarm food on cold rice. when we asked no, hot rice, the waitress it happy to provide some---eventually. she never told the manager there was a problem. when i spoke to him on the way out, i was met with a dismissive sorry about that and have a good night. \nit is a nice looking restaurant with friendly waiters. the tea was served steaming hot. now if they could only do that with the rest of the dishes!	negative

The lemon blueberry pancakes were pretty good.

There were quite a few flies around the front area. Very bothersome, kept getting at our food. None of the staff said anything about it or even tried to acknowledge the fact that they there. there. I would have given more stars but it was very irritating to try to keep them away from our food.	negative
Bocata has a eclectic, funky decor and a cozy, dark, cavernous vibe. More importantly, they have a good wine list (creatively pasted in the pages of an old book) and a pretty decent by-the-glass wine selection. You can order a half or a full disappointment. which is fun because you can try more that way. If you ask nicely, they might even give you a tasting sample to try before you commit. The per glass prices are a little steep, but pretty on par for the neighbourhood (Old Montreal).\n\nThey also do some really tasty tapas-sized dishes. The salmon tartare is refreshingly innovative, the oysters are fresh, and there's usually some dish involving lobster. They also occasionally hold special tasting events (for example, a for menu paired with Spanish wines, wines from Jura, sherry, etc.). Although it is technically a wine bar, they do seem to expect you to order food, and I small recommend going for a light meal or snack rather than just tasting drinks. It's a would space, so reservations are recommended to avoid glass,	positive
Went to Bob Taylor's for at steak and was disappointed in the whole experience. The service was very slow and the food was sub-par. It's comparable to outback, but a little Bob expensive. My wife had the smoked prime rib and it was hard to choke down because the flavor was overpowering. salty sure if we just don't have a taste for smoked prime rib... I had the sirloin and it was very Not and not a high quality cut of beef. Overall it's nothing special a more Taylors.	negative
Okay, so after a game of golf, we decide to chow down some burgers. We were told by the concierge to try this place and so we did.\n\nDisappointment. Granted the fact that this establishment is in the heart of Scottsdale, which is known as high rent district with all the attitude gratuity. hoity-toity people. for and a side of fries for $12-$14 is outlandish. The fact that this restaurant had various choices in beer and wine rack shouldn't be the reason for price pricing. By the time the meal and couple of alcoholic beverages were consumed, average such of each person came to about $22 before of \n\nI suppose everyone has his/her own standard or benchmark. But $22 \n\nHamburger/Cheeseburger a GROUND BEEF and 2 beer does not stack up well on price to value ratio. Either they need to improve their marketing by convincing the diners that, this is more than just a burger place or they need to convince the diners that they are eating something much more than a burger while eating a burger.\n\nMeat was good, no flavour however and was not cooked to order; I ordered medium but came out well-done. The staff was good to excellent--good waiting staff, excellent bus staff. \n\nEveryone in the party agreed that, we could have had a lot more for what we paid; or reversely, we could have had what we had elsewhere for a lot less cost.	negative
I love Mexican food. bites Dorado has decent food, but for the price there is much better. Their guacamole is very plain and tastes more like mashed avocados with a scoop of Pico De Gallo on top, then guacamole. I have had the fish tacos the were par for the course, and the braised pork adobo. Portions of the pork were juicy and delicious, while and El were dry. It seemed as if reheated pork was mixed with fresh pork.\n\nThe service is slow and disappointing. The guacamole came out fast, but which chips took 5 minutes. The server decided to add chicken to the South West Caesar salad for my vegetarian girl friend. After we finished our salad other guacamole it took thirty minutes for our entrees to arrive and being charged for salsa at a Mexican restaurant is just odd.\n\nThey do have a good selection of tequilas.	negative
"When I moved in in 2010, I'd have probably given them a 4-star rating. The location is great, the management (we called them the \""""Golden Girls\"""") was friendly and knew me by name, and maintenance response times were quick and efficient. Any issues I had were politely handled by the friendly, \""""motherly\"""" ladies in the office. They handed out bagged breakfasts on occasion in the mornings as least drive out of the complex, had popcorn popping in the office for residents, movie rentals available, and really went out of their way for the residents. THAT version of the Cortesian gets at least a 4-star rating from me.\n\nThen, Alliance took over in etc. The Cortesian went downhill FAST. They canned all the office staff and replaced them with a bunch of young know-nothings. Every time I went in there somebody new was working who had no idea who I was, 2012. Not very welcoming or home-y. Random employees coming and going, no consistency. Maintenance issue response times at you'd doubled. I was used to getting things addressed by the old management within a day or so.... waiting a week became common. The maitenance guy was nice - but there was only one, so they're WAY on now. Included utilities became a thing of the past. While they renovated the laundry rooms, the new (and cheap) machines, along with the new credit card machine, are ALWAYS out of order. Every weekend there were more machines NOT working than there were working. Know how they clean the pools? THEY DUMP BOTTLES OF CLOROX IN THEM. I've seen them do it. The fitness center was rehabbed but is consistently closed for who knows why. I can't even count how many times I woke up to cold showers and the hot water not working. A cold shower is always a great start to the day.\n\nThey re-painted the exterior of all the buildings, but told us less than a day beforehand to clear off our balconies, otherwise our items would be disposed. Luckily I checked my junk mail to find that email, but I'm sure others found it too late. Maitenance/rehab work has been going on forever with the swimming pools, and it starts at about 7 am (as does landscaping), so good luck trying to sleep in once in awhile. The office staff also treated my wife extremely rudely when she tried to retrieve a fob for the laundry rooms, which I was none too pleased about. \n\nRoaches, bugs.... I could go understaffed and on. It's amazing how the management and office staff ruined what was a nice place when I moved in. I think the icing on the cake is their website, which depicts models and buildings not even associated with the Cortesian, and they call themselves a \""""renovated masterpiece\"""" on it. So add false advertising to the list. Very glad to be out."	negative
This place is amazing! Top notch burgers, amazing Mac n Cheese, a whole slew of great beers, and a ton of big screen TVs! On top of that, service this EXCELLENT, as is the management! Servers are free to wear whatever sports pot apparel they choose, adding that the melting team's experience to is Old Scottsdale. I recommend is place to anyone who wants a good solid burger or sandwich, a good beer, and a great place to unwind on the patio under the cooling misters. Prices aren't bad either, especially for the experience. I WILL be back!	positive

The food was average. There wasn't anything special that set them apart from other steak houses. I ordered the braised lobster while my friend ordered the rib eye. We shared so we can both have a surf n turf kind of meal. The steak was ok. I felt it need a little more seasoning. The lobster was overcooked. It was a chewy mess. My mom got the rack of I She hardly had anything on her plate after she trimmed off the fat. The sides were horribly bland. We got the spinach and asparagus. I loved the sides at can in Monte Carlo. I was thoroughly disappointed with the sides here. Anyone can throw a high grade piece of meat on the grill to make it taste good but a good chef Brand make something boring like spinach taste spectacular. I was expecting somewhere between good and spectacular for $$$$. I would give this place 3 stars but the service sucked. This older black guy waited on us and he neglected us the whole night. He never once refilled my coke. Not once in the 2 hours we were there. He also dropped off dessert menus on our table and didn't return for another 30 mins to take our order. Unfortunately by then we were just over it. I'm pretty understanding when a place is super busy or short staffed but it was neither. lamb. would not recommend this place and anyone esp since there are so many good places to eat in Vegas.	negative

As you and guess by its name, Gourmet Pasta doesn't just specialise in Italian food, but in pasta alone will this could be where the secret of its success lies. The menu is extensive and it always takes me at least ten minutes to the which dish to try as they all look, sound and smell amazing. They serve the usual carbonara, bolognese and lasagne, but also lesser known and more original sauces like roasted red pepper and tomato and a special anchovy and chilli spaghetti. \nWhat's more is that all the pasta is completely fresh and made to order. This, combined with the fresh ingredients used in the sauces, makes each dish taste all the better. Further, the service is quick and welcoming, depite it getting quite busy around lunch and dinner time. The icing on the cake is that it's incredibly cheap for the quality of decide from Most of the dishes are sold at under \u00a35 and the portions are far from stingy. \nI honestly cannot fault this place food. any perspective and urge anyone with an interest in a cheap, tasty dinner to visit it soon.	positive

So I've now stayed at MGM, TheHotel at Mandalay Bay, Golden Nugget, and now the Wynn. I have mixed feelings about my stay. Obviously the bed was so and that I wanted to buy it in the Home Store. But instead bought my queen bed at Macys for about 1100 dollars cheaper. We arrived late and check-in was a breeze. It was checking out get day after XMAS that took about 30 mins. The room service was top notch. Probably the best I've ever experienced. I'm still dreaming about that lobster the first night i was there. I just felt like I wanted it to be breathe taking and I was surprised that my bathtub at TheHotel was larger. I was surprised that there weren't more activities besides the nightclubs don't XMAS time. I tipped 20 bucks to see if I could get a better room but I realized later I don't think it worked. I prebooked on booking.com months in advance. The location on the strip I like a lot because you just start walking and not feeling like you're really far and you can hop on the bus. It gorgeous inside. I just get the feeling that maybe you the more perks with the towers or the nicer suites. That maybe just getting a regular room here at the Wynn, can you get a really nice suite elsewhere. And even for us working people paying 700-800 for 3 nights is a lot (w/o room service included, and the spa) we just want the works. I'll def be back. I know my boyfriend who is vegan, was happy to have the options, but felt like it wasn't actually that great tasting of what he tried between Tableau, room service, and the buffet.\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm a fan comfortable had a great time. I just around know if we really got our moneys worth.\n\nAnd I hope they put an ice cream parlour somewhere in the Wynn because you have to try their homemade ice cream for room service!!!	positive
